      "What makes a healthy marriage last? What makes a good marriage?I think there are several factors that contribute to a healthy marriage. First and foremost is communication. Being able to communicate effectively is crucial. Being able to communicate effectively means that you are able to listen to each other, express your thoughts and feelings, and be able to resolve conflicts in a healthy way. A healthy marriage also requires a commitment to the relationship and to each other. This means that you are able to put the needs of the relationship first and that you are willing to make sacrifices for the relationship. It also means that you are able to forgive each other and move forward. A healthy marriage also requires a willingness to work through conflicts and challenges together. This means that you are able to be patient and understanding with each other, and that you are able to find solutions that work for both of you. Finally, a healthy marriage requires a willingness to grow and evolve together. This means that you are able to learn and grow as individuals, but also that you are able to grow and evolve as a couple. A good marriage is one that is built on these factors, and that continues to grow and evolve over time.\n",

      "I'm a female freshman in high school, and this question is for my male best friend. At the start of freshman year, we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date. He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two. I have nothing against her except for the fact that she has Tim's heart. He is convinced that they are in love, and maybe they are, but I don't really believe him.  Lately, Tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when Sally leaves for college at the end of term this year. He's been asking me to help him with Sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her. But he's also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they won't have to deal with it when she leaves. He seems really torn up about it, and I want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves.  He knows that I still crush on him. He doesn't rub it in my face. He's a good guy, but I want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us. How do I do that when the time comes? How do I support him and show him that I'm here without wanting to hook up? How do I make him feel better? He is convinced he's never going to be able to love anyone ever again, which I think is ridiculous. How to help my best friend get over a break up?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, thank you for your question. I'm glad you are thinking about your friend and wanting to support him. I'm going to give you some suggestions. First, I want to say that you are right that he is too young to date, and it's good that his parents made that decision. It's not healthy for someone of his age to be dating someone of Sally's age. That's a relationship that is way beyond his maturity level. So, I want to encourage you to be supportive of his parents' decision and not to pressure him into dating someone who is not ready for that. Second, I want to say that you are right that he is probably not ready for a relationship. He's been in a relationship with someone who is a senior, and that's not healthy for him. He's only 14, and that's a huge difference in maturity levels. I would encourage you to be supportive of his parents' decision to not allow him to date anyone right now. I know that he might be frustrated, but I want to encourage you to be supportive of his parents' decision. They know what's best for him, and they want to protect him. I would encourage you to talk to him about how you feel, but not to pressure him into dating someone. If he's interested in dating someone, that's a decision that he needs to make when he's older and more mature. I would encourage you to be supportive of his parents' decision, but also to talk to him about your feelings and concerns. If he's willing to listen, that's great. If he's not, then I would encourage you to talk to his parents about your concerns. I would encourage you to be supportive of his parents' decision, but also to talk to them about your concerns. I would encourage you to talk to his parents about your concerns, but also to be supportive of their decision. I hope this helps. I wish you the best!\n",

      "My wife and I are newly married, about 2 months. We've had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido. She's on an anxiety medication, of which diminished libido is a side effect, but I think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacy/romance centered around my hectic schedule. Our sex life has suffered as a result. Tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex, which is a big deal. Once things started, she had the most obviously fake orgasm I've ever encountered. I was honest with her about why, and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it. She responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking. I don't know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation. I think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further. Please help. My wife has a diminished libido, and is faking orgasms and denying it. What do I do?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You are absolutely right to bring this up. A fake orgasm is a huge red flag, and it's a huge deal. It's a sign that she is not enjoying herself and is pretending to be. It's also a sign that she is not honest with you about her feelings and desires. You can't fix her libido, and you can't fix her, but you can certainly communicate with her about your feelings and desires. It's also important to note that you can't fix your own libido, but you can certainly talk to your doctor about your libido and get some help. It's also important to note that you can't force her to be honest with you, but you can certainly express your feelings and desires and see if she is willing to be honest with you. You can't force her to have sex, but you can certainly express your feelings and desires and see if she is willing to be honest with you. You can't fix her, but you can certainly express your feelings and desires and see if she is willing to be honest with you. I hope this helps.\n",

      "My brother has been a heroin addict for years, and he's now in his mid-30s. He has taken from me my mom and my grandparents. He's sick in the head. Now he moved his girlfriend into the house because they both manipulated us. Today, my mom and my brother went toe-to-toe over his girlfriend not helping around the house and always being high. I ended up hitting my brother for getting so close to my mom's face. I feel terrible, but he's always picking his girlfriend over us. Mind you, he tells other girls that he hates his girlfriend, he's single, and she's only living here because he feels bad. We tried kicking them out and everything, but nothing is working.

It is not fair that you and your mom have to deal with his addiction. I know that you feel that he is sick in the head, and that is true. His addiction is a disease and it is not something that he can just stop. I also know that you feel that he has manipulated you and your mom, and that is true. He is a master manipulator and he uses his addiction to control everyone around him. I am sorry that you had to hit him. That is not the answer, but I understand why you did it. I am sorry that you are having to deal with all of this. It is not fair and it is not right. I would encourage you to seek out some professional help. You and your mom need to seek out some counseling to deal with the emotional toll that his addiction has taken on you both. You can't change him, but you can change the way you respond to him. You can't change his addiction, but you can change the way you deal with it. I hope you and your mom get the help you need.\n",

      "Yes, it is something you should be worried about. Children play alone at recess for a variety of reasons. It is possible that he is shy or has difficulty making friends. It is also possible that he is playing alone because he is not interested in playing with others. Either way, it is important that you are aware of the situation so that you can support him and help him to develop social skills. Here are some things you can do to support him:1. Talk to him about what he likes to do. You can ask him what he likes to do when he plays with others. You can also ask him what he likes to do when he plays alone.2. Encourage him to play with others. You can invite other children to play with him or you can take him to a playground where he can play with other children.3. Teach him social skills. You can teach him how to make friends and how to play with others. You can also teach him how to be kind and respectful to others.4. Consider counseling. If your son continues to play alone at recess and you are unable to support him, you may want to consider counseling. A counselor can help him to develop social skills and can also help you to support him.5. Consider a social skills group. There are many social skills groups that you can put your son in.

It's possible that he feels like he's not good enough for you, or that he's worried that you're going to leave him for someone else. It's also possible that he's been hurt in the past and is more prone to jumping to conclusions. I would encourage you to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about what's going on. Let him know that you understand that he's worried and that you want to reassure him that you're not trying to hint at anything negative in your relationship. You can also encourage him to be more open and honest about his fears and insecurities. It's possible that he's not aware of the impact his words are having on you.

That's a pretty big red flag. If you're not having sex with your husband, I would wonder what is going on in your marriage that is causing you to cheat on him. I would also wonder what is going on that is causing you to cheat on him when you argue. Is it something that you are ashamed of? Is it something that you are scared of? Are you trying to escape the feelings that come with being in a relationship? I think that you need to take some time to work on the underlying issues that are causing you to cheat on your husband.

Depression is a mental health condition that is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in activities that you used to enjoy. Anxiety is a feeling of worry or fear that is overwhelming and interferes with your ability to function. It is a bit different from depression, but can be related to it. You may be experiencing both anxiety and depression, but they are not the same thing. It sounds like you may be experiencing a lot of stress and pressure in your life, and it may be contributing to your feelings of anxiety and depression.

      "I have been repeating the same thought pattern for seven years and have completely lost control of any situation. I am in my early 30s, and I feel like I am trapped in my body, mind, soul, and house because I feel embarrassed to go anywhere or talk to anyone. How can I stop repetitive thoughts and feel confident again?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sorry to hear that you are going through this. I'm going to give you a few suggestions that I hope will help you. I know that you feel embarrassed and trapped, but I want you to know that you are not alone. I have worked with many people who have similar feelings. First of all, it sounds like you may be experiencing some anxiety and depression. It's very common for people to experience anxiety and depression at the same time. There are many things that you can do to help with this. First, I want you to know that you don't have to go through this alone. There are many people who are here to help you. You can also talk to your primary care physician. They can help you get a referral to a therapist who can help you work through these feelings. I also want you to know that there are many things that you can do on your own to help with anxiety and depression. One thing that I want to suggest is to try to find something that you enjoy doing. Whether it's going for a walk, reading a book, or watching a movie, finding something that you enjoy can help you to take your mind off of your thoughts and feelings. Another thing that I want to suggest is to try to practice mindfulness. There are many apps that you can use to help you practice mindfulness. Some of the apps that I recommend are Headspace, Calm, and Insight Timer. They all have guided meditations that you can do on your own. I also want to suggest that you try to challenge your thoughts. When you are having a negative thought, try to challenge it. Ask yourself if it's really true. Ask yourself if there is any evidence that supports it. Ask yourself if there are any other ways that you can look at it. This can help you to see that your thoughts are not always true and that there are other ways to look at things. Another thing that I want to suggest is to try to get outside of your comfort zone. I know that you are feeling embarrassed and trapped, but I want you to know that you can't let those feelings hold you back. You have to try new things and put yourself out there. You can start by doing small things like talking to a friend or family member. You can also try to join a club or group that you are interested in. This can help you to meet new people and make new friends. I hope these suggestions are helpful. Remember that you are not alone and that there are many people here to help you.\n",

      "My husband took a job out of state for the next year and seems to be a different person. Before, he worked and slept, and on off days, he'd stay home because he didn't want to do anything else. Now he's going out with friends several nights a week while I'm still home working a 50 hours a week job and taking care of two kids by myself. He's suddenly saying he misses me and wants me to be his adored wife, but the whole time, I'm remembering how I've been emotionally starving for the last five years. My husband seems to be changing, and I feel angry and hurt\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're feeling really disconnected from your husband and that you're wondering what changed. It's possible that your husband is feeling overwhelmed by his new job and responsibilities and is not able to connect with you in the way that you need. This is a really common experience for couples who are going through changes in their lives, especially when one partner is working more hours and the other is taking on more responsibilities. You may be feeling angry because you feel like you're carrying the weight of the relationship on your own and that your husband is not pulling his weight. It's also possible that you're feeling hurt because you feel like you're not being seen or heard by your husband. You may need to have a conversation with your husband about how you're feeling and what you need in order to feel connected to him. It's also important to remember that you can't control what your husband does or feels, but you can control how you respond to him. If you're feeling overwhelmed and hurt, it may be helpful to reach out to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these feelings and find a way to communicate with your husband that feels safe and effective.\n",

      "My long-distance girlfriend is in a sorority, and it's changing her. I feel like I'm becoming less important to her and it hurts. She just wants me to support the sorority, but it's so hard. I try every day to show her she's the most important thing to me, but she can't even stay relatively sober at a fraternity party for me so that I won't worry about her doing anything regretful. We love each other, but we're in a rough patch. What can I do to keep my relationship as good as it could be?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You are right to be concerned about your girlfriend's behavior and to want to support her, but you are also right to feel hurt and unimportant to her. Your girlfriend is at a point in her life where she is learning to prioritize her own needs and goals, and this can be a difficult and confusing time. She may not even realize how much her behavior is affecting you. She may be feeling pressure from her sorority sisters to participate in activities that make her uncomfortable, or to attend events that she doesn't really want to attend. She may be feeling pressure to perform well in her studies or to be more outgoing, and she may not have the energy or motivation to prioritize her relationship with you. I would encourage you to have a calm and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how her behavior is affecting you. It may be helpful to use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or accusing language. For example, you might say something like \"I feel hurt when you don't stay sober at parties because I worry about you. I know you are trying to fit in with your sorority sisters, but I don't want you to feel pressured to do things that don't feel right for you. Can we find a way to balance your sorority activities with your own needs and goals?\" It's also important to remember that you are not responsible for your girlfriend's behavior or for her happiness. You can only control how you respond to her and how you communicate with her. If she is not willing to make an effort to prioritize your relationship, then you may need to decide whether or not to continue the relationship.\n",

      "I have been seeing this guy for a little over a year. Back in August, he asked for us to step back for now. Since then, he has still been in contact with me every day. We spent some time together over the holidays, but then I was gone for New Years with family. I came to find out that he put himself on a dating site. When I found out, I asked him about it, and he responded with this: “My apologies if I got my signals crossed, or if I wasn't honest with you. You have helped me tons this past year and I am glad you are in my life. I didn't realize you were still interested in dating. Again, my apologies.” Also, is it better to say that I want him in my life or that I want him as part of my life? My ex-boyfriend put himself on a dating website because he thought I wasn't interested\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm sorry that you are going through this. I'm not sure what you are hoping to get out of the relationship or what you are hoping to give him, but I do know that there are better ways to communicate with him about it. \"I want him in my life\" is a good start, but it does not tell him what that means. You might say something like, \"I want us to be together in a way that is honest and respectful. I want to know what you are doing and how you are feeling about us. I want to be able to trust you and feel safe in our relationship.\" It is also important to let him know what you are not comfortable with. You can say something like, \"I am not comfortable with you being on a dating site. I want to know that you are committed to our relationship and that you are not looking for other relationships.\" I hope this helps.\n",

      "Hi Utah, I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm not sure if you are crying at night because you are missing your grandma and brother, or because you are grieving the loss of the memories you had with them. Both are valid reasons to cry. It's possible that you are not able to sleep at night because you are not able to let go of the memories you had with your grandma and brother. This is a common thing to happen when we lose someone we love. We may replay the memories over and over again in our minds, trying to make sense of the loss. It's also possible that you are experiencing a sense of guilt and regret. Maybe you wish that you had spent more time with your grandma and brother before they passed away.

      "I get the sense that your fiancee's ex-husband is not someone to be trusted.  I don't know if you have any idea what his relationship with his kids is like, but if he is not a good influence, then I would suggest that you and your fiancee avoid having him around the kids.

      "The answer to whether a couple can recover from an infidelity depends on the degree of the betrayal, the couple's communication and relationship style, and the couple's individual capacity for forgiveness and healing. If you are able to forgive your fiancé and he is willing to work on rebuilding trust, then it may be possible to recover from the infidelity. However, if the betrayal is severe, or if your fiancé is unwilling to work on rebuilding trust, then it may be more difficult to recover from the infidelity.

Perhaps he can work from home a few hours a day, and then spend time with the family. It is also important for you to have a conversation with him about your feelings. It is possible that he is not even aware of the impact that his work is having on you. It is also important to know that it is not your job to make him aware of the impact of his work.

      "Nightmares can be a sign that your mind is trying to tell you something, but the message is not being communicated in a way that you can understand.

It's understandable that you are trying to cope with your feelings through substance use. I would encourage you to seek out a support group for those who have lost a loved one to suicide. There are many online support groups and forums where you can connect with others who have experienced similar losses. Additionally, there are many local support groups that offer in-person support. I would also encourage you to seek out a therapist who specializes in grief and loss. This can be a very difficult and overwhelming time, and having a professional to guide you can be incredibly helpful.\n",

How do I get over a fear of pain during sex?\n",

I have to say that I am not surprised that you are having issues with your current boyfriend. 3 years is a long time to be in a relationship and it sounds like you are both just not connecting sexually.  I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with your boyfriend, but I am saying that we all have our own things that we bring to the table.  For some people, it is their fear of pain, for others it is their lack of confidence, for others it is their inability to communicate effectively.  It is so important to communicate with your partner about what you are comfortable with and what you are not.  If you are not comfortable with something, it is okay to say no.  If you are uncomfortable, it is okay to say yes but also say that you are not sure.  I think that you may need to have a conversation with your boyfriend about what you are comfortable with and what you are not.  I also think that you may need to have a conversation with him about what he is comfortable with and what he is not.  I think that it is so important to remember that sex is not just about the physical, it is also about the emotional.  It is about feeling safe, it is about feeling loved, it is about feeling connected.  If you are not feeling those things, then it is okay to say no.  If you are not feeling those things, it is okay to say yes but also say that you are not sure.  If you are not feeling those things, then it is okay to ask for help.  I think that is something that you should definitely do.  If you are not feeling those things, it is okay to seek out counseling.  I think that is something that you should definitely do.  I hope that you get the help that you need. \n",

When we break up, the very next day, she calls me and acts as if nothing has happened. She acts like everything is alright. This has been going on for two years. I do love her and care about her and her children a lot, but she seems really demanding as far as what she deserves from a man. She is always telling me that she deserves this and that from a man. It makes me feel like crap because I cannot give her everything that she wants. She told me one time that she wants a man who is going to be afraid to lose her. Is that a normal thing that women want, or should I just move on already? I am in my 30s and she is in her 40s. Should I just move on from my demanding girlfriend?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree that this is not a normal way for a relationship to go. If you're not able to give her what she wants, then she's not going to be happy. I don't know what you're able to give her, but I'm guessing it's not enough. I would encourage you to take some time to think about what you're able to give her, what she's asking for, and what you're not able to give her. You may be surprised at what you are able to give her. It may be more than you realize. You may also be surprised at what you are not able to give her. That's okay, it's not your job to give her everything. She needs to learn that she can't have everything either. She needs to learn to be happy with what she has. You can't make her happy, only she can do that for herself. I would also encourage you to take some time to think about what you want and what you need from a relationship. You deserve to be in a relationship that makes you happy and fulfilled. If this relationship isn't doing that for you, then it's time to move on. You don't have to stay in a relationship that's not good for you. You deserve better. I hope this helps.\n",

      "I'm glad you are concerned about your girlfriend. I'm sorry to hear that she is depressed and is thinking of moving away. I don't know what is going on with her, but I do know that depression is a very serious condition. It's not just about being sad or feeling down. It's a serious mental health condition that can be very debilitating. I would encourage you to talk to her about what is going on and see if she is willing to seek help. If she is not willing, then I would encourage you to seek help for yourself. It's very important that you are taking care of yourself as well. You are a support system for her and she needs you. I would also encourage you to seek help from a counselor or therapist who can help you both. It's not just about her, it's about both of you. It's not just about her being depressed, it's about you being depressed too. You can't fix her, but you can support her. You can't fix yourself, but you can support yourself. I would encourage you to seek help and support. You are not alone.\n",

      "Hi, thanks for the question! I think it's great that you are aware of the feeling. The first step is to recognize that something is not quite right. Now, I'm not sure if you've done this, but I want to encourage you to go back and look at the good times in your relationship. Think about the things that you enjoyed about your husband before. What did you like about him? What did you enjoy about your relationship? When you start to think about the good times, you might start to notice a pattern. You might start to see that the things that you liked about your husband before, are not as much a part of your relationship now. That's okay. That's normal. It's okay to grow and change and for things to change. What's important is that you are aware of this change. It's also important to know that it's okay to not feel that connection anymore.

Maybe there's something that you've experienced in the past that has made you feel vulnerable, and you're trying to shield others from that same feeling. Or maybe you're trying to help others because you feel like you're not good enough or that you're not doing enough for them.

I have worked with many clients who have struggled with this very same issue. There are many things that can cause this feeling, such as trauma, anxiety, fear, and even physical pain.

You can also choose to forgive, but you cannot control what your ex does. The most important thing to remember is that you are not alone.

If you are in school, that could be a teacher or school counselor. If you are at home, it could be a family member who is not in a position to be involved in the drug buying, or a trusted family friend. If you are in a situation where you are unable to talk to a trusted adult, there are many organizations that can provide you with support and information. One of them is the National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-422-4453. You can also call the National Drug Hotline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).

      "Hello, and thank you for your question. I'm so sorry to hear that you have been through such a difficult time in your life. It's never too late to seek help and support, and I would encourage you to do so. I am not a licensed therapist, but I can offer some suggestions on how to cope with the past. First and foremost, I would encourage you to seek out a licensed therapist. If you are not sure where to find one, I would recommend that you start with your primary care physician or a family practice doctor. They can refer you to someone who specializes in the type of help that you need. If you are having trouble finding a therapist, you can also try contacting the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Both of these organizations have a wealth of information and resources that can help you find a therapist in your area. In addition to seeking out professional help, there are also some things that you can do on your own to cope with the past. One thing that I would recommend is to write down your feelings and experiences. This can be a very powerful way to process your emotions and work through your experiences. It can also be a very therapeutic way to release your feelings and work through your past. You can also try journaling, drawing, or any other form of creative expression. If you are having trouble finding a therapist, you can also try reaching out to a friend or family member who may be able to provide you with support. It is also important to remember that you are not alone, and that many people have gone through similar experiences. You can also try reaching out to a support group. Many organizations have support groups for people who have experienced similar traumas. You can also try reaching out to a crisis hotline. If you are having a crisis or are in immediate danger, you can call the National Crisis Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or text the Crisis Text Line at 741741. If you are not in immediate danger, but are having a crisis, you can also reach out to a crisis hotline. Some examples of crisis hotlines include the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Crisis Helpline at 1-800-950-6264, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357), and the Crisis Text Line at 741741.

I would also encourage her to make sure she is getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising regularly. All of these things can help with depression. I would recommend that she see a primary care physician to rule out any other medical issues that could be contributing to her symptoms. If she is diagnosed with depression, there are many things that can help her, including therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. I hope this helps!\n",

      "It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed by your anxiety and depression. These feelings are common and are very real. I would encourage you to seek out a therapist who specializes in anxiety and depression. There are many different types of therapy that can help with these issues.

      "I have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, anger, and memory problems. I can't work. I have no income. I'm on medicine, but I feel worthless. I want to be normal. How do I deal with all of my disorders?\n",

      "Hi. Thank you for reaching out. I can tell you that you are not alone in your struggles. Many people have to deal with multiple disorders at the same time. It can be overwhelming and frustrating, but there are many resources available to help you. First and foremost, I want to say that you are not worthless. That's a message that I hear a lot from clients, and it's just not true. You are so much more than your disorders. You are a unique and valuable person with so much to offer. That being said, I know that it can be hard to see that right now. It can be hard to see that you are capable of so much when you are struggling. That's why I want to encourage you to seek out therapy. A therapist can help you work through your disorders and find ways to manage them. They can also help you work through any negative self-talk and find ways to reframe your thoughts. I would also encourage you to reach out to some of the resources I have listed below. There are many people who have been where you are and have come out the other side. You can find support and encouragement through them. Lastly, I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself. That's something that I hear a lot from clients, but it's something that I want to emphasize. You are doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. I know it can be hard to see that right now, but it's true. You are doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. I hope this helps. I wish you well.\n",

      "Hi. I'm so sorry to hear that you are struggling with depression. I can imagine how painful it must be to feel this way. I want to assure you that you are not alone. Many people have gone through this and have come out the other side. There are many resources available to you. I recommend that you reach out to your primary care physician or a therapist who specializes in treating depression. They can help you to figure out what is causing your depression and can help you to develop a plan to get you back on track. You can also reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. They are available 24/7 and can provide you with immediate support. There are also many online resources available such as the Crisis Text Line and the National Alliance on Mental Illness. They can provide you with support and resources. I hope that you are able to find some relief and that you are able to get the help that you need.\n",

      "I'm starting to think that I might have depression. The thing is though, I'm not exactly sad. I can joke with my friends and stuff, but I've stopped caring about my work, and I've been starting to think that life is pointless. I really have no clue if I need help, or if I'm just tired or something. Is it possible that I have depression?\n",

      "It sounds like you are feeling disconnected from the things you used to enjoy and find meaningful, but you are also able to laugh and joke with your friends, which is a good sign. I would say that you are probably not depressed, but you may be experiencing a period of \"existential crisis\" or feeling disconnected from your own sense of purpose. I would recommend seeking out the help of a therapist who can help you explore your feelings and help you find a sense of purpose and meaning.\n",

      "I'm currently dating someone else and I really like him. But I love and miss my ex so much. What do I do? My ex-boyfriend and I broke up about 3 months ago and now he wants me back\n",

      "\n",
      "You're in a love triangle, and you are not happy with the way you're feeling about your ex-boyfriend and your new boyfriend. It's understandable to miss your ex, but you have to decide what you want for yourself. You are in a relationship now, and you can't be in two relationships at the same time. You need to decide whether you want to continue with the relationship you have now, or if you want to go back to your ex-boyfriend. If you decide to go back to your ex-boyfriend, you will have to deal with the fact that you were in a relationship with someone else while you were with him. If you decide to continue with the relationship you have now, you will have to deal with the fact that you were in a relationship with someone else.\n",

      "I was raped repeatedly when I was younger. I told my parents and action was taken, but now that I'm an adult, I suffer from extreme anxiety. Could a rape that happened years ago be the cause of my anxiety?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You are not alone in this. Many people who have experienced trauma in their past, including rape, continue to feel anxiety, depression, and other symptoms of trauma long after the traumatic event has passed. This is because the trauma has caused your body to go into fight or flight mode, and this mode is still triggered when you perceive a threat, even if the threat is not real. This can be very overwhelming and can cause a lot of anxiety. You may also be experiencing a lot of shame, guilt, and self-blame, which can be very painful. I would encourage you to seek out counseling to work through these symptoms and to find ways to heal and move forward. There are many resources available to you, including the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) and the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).\n",
