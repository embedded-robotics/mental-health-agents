      "Life is so stagnant. I can't seem to motivate myself to care about anything outside of what I'm told is needed to be done by me. I go to work because I'm told it's what I need to do to support my mom and sister. So I do what needs to be done, but when all is done, I feel like I'm rotting in a perfectly good body that should've gone to someone who would more enjoy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no satisfaction in my job, I work alone all day tortured by my own mind for 8 hours day, this pushes me to the point of physically beating on myself in hopes I calm down enough to keep working. I've started smoking whatever is able to be acquired legally to get theiught work. I wake up dreading work and miserable, wanting all day for it to end, just to come home and then rot doing nothing. I'll listen to music, or play games but only because it's what I used to do, I don't feel nearly any joy playing games anymore compared to how it used to be. I buy more games, to then not play them and complain there is nothing to do. Soon I find myself somehow wanting to go back to work, yet every fiber in my body knows that can't be true. It's a torturous, confusing cycle that never ends.\n",

Her death scares me and it may be the only thing in this world that truly does anymore, however I'm unwilling to make her say goodbye her son, especially after she had to do so with her husband. While Dad's death definitely had an affect on me, I can't say I havent felt this way long before it. Even at 12, life always seemed pointless, and ever sense 14 the idea or being dead has looked far more favorable. I do feel awful about it, my mom tries so hard to bring happiness to me and it just seems I can't feel it anymore. I feel like a black sheep in the world of happy people but I know that can't be true. My mom lost her husband, my sister her dad. It's no secret they aren't happy, yet they can still put on an act and try their hardest, yet here I am. I am the killjoy, I bring the mood down even my own dogs are standoffish.\n",

I can't help but feel that after all my business is taken care of I will leave here, not as a matter of if but when, by my own hands and that is a relief. I would be lying if I said suicide doesn't have a home inside my brain. It's with me from time I wake up to the time I shut my eyes, most if not everyday. The intensity varies, some days it's just a \"I wish I wasn't alive\" and other days I can imagine my body slapping right into the ocean 200ft down to be found by whoever stumbles across my corpse. It comforts me knowing that whatever/whenever I deem life has gone \"too far\" I can always end my life, leaving behind mountains on anxiety, disappointment, regrets and resentment towards both this world and myself.\n",

      "I'm not looking for help as much as to rant, trying not to just drink away these emotions tonight. I know I have something wrong inside my head, I know I should seek therapy, but something in me doesn't want to. There's comfort in this illness, comfort that the day life gets too overwhelming, the day the one person I care about finally goes, I can finally say I've tried my hardest and then let go of everything too.\n"
