       "[\"Therapy Plan:\\n\\n1. Establish Trust and Safety: The primary goal is to establish a safe environment where the user feels comfortable expressing their feelings. This involves maintaining confidentiality and showing empathy towards the user's situation.\\n\\n2. Cognitive Restructuring: This involves identifying and challenging the user's negative thoughts and beliefs. For this person, this would involve addressing their feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and suicidal thoughts.\\n\\n3. Behavioral Activation: Help the user to engage in activities they previously enjoyed or may enjoy, to help reduce their feelings of hopelessness and increase their motivation.\\n\\n4. Grief Counseling: Given the user's fear of losing their mother and the impact of their father's death, grief counseling could be beneficial. This would involve helping the user process their feelings of loss and fear.\\n\\n5. Coping Skills and Stress Management: Teach the user effective coping strategies to handle their daily stressors, especially related to their job and familial responsibilities.\\n\\n6. Substance Use Intervention: Given the user's mention of smoking to cope with work, addressing substance use would be important. This could involve providing resources for substance abuse or exploring healthier coping mechanisms.\\n\\nTherapy Counsel:\\n\\nI appreciate your honesty in expressing your feelings, and it's important to remember that it's okay to feel this way. However, it's equally important to remember that there are healthier ways to cope with these feelings.\\n\\nOne thing that could be beneficial is to engage in activities that you previously enjoyed. You mentioned listening to music and playing games. Even if you don't feel the same joy, it's still important to engage in these activities, as they can help to break up the monotony of your daily routine.\\n\\nIt's clear that you're carrying a heavy burden, especially with the loss of your father and your fear of losing your mother. It's perfectly normal to feel this way, and it's okay to grieve. However, it's also important to remember that it's okay to seek help, whether it be from a professional or from your loved ones.\\n\\nYou also mentioned feeling like a black sheep and like you're bringing others down. It's important to remember that everyone has their own struggles, and it's okay to not always be happy. However, it's also important to not isolate yourself, as this can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and despair.\\n\\nLastly, you mentioned using substances to help cope with work. While this may provide temporary relief, it's not a healthy long-term solution. There are other, healthier ways to cope with stress, such as exercise, meditation, or talking to someone about your feelings.\\n\\nIt's clear that you're going through a lot, and it's okay to seek help. You don't have to go through this alone. There are resources available to help you, and it's okay to use them. You're not alone, and it's okay to ask for help.\",\n",
