I’m now at a point in my life where I should be happy, I have a nice car, a good job with colleagues who respect me and with whom I get along well, I’m doing well in school and I have good friends who care about me, my relationship with my siblings is also great. I don’t have to worry about rent or living expenses beyond gas for my car, I don’t have student loans bc I have scholarships that pay for my tuition and books. My physical health is good, I’ve been eating healthy and exercising at least 4 times per week. I have it all but I still feel like I have nothing. I still feel so empty and I’m lonely even when I’m surrounded by friends and family. I’m touch starved yet the thought of having someone touch me makes me nauseous, and I don even know how I’d ask for a hug even if I wanted one. I experienced physical, emotional and verbal abuse growing up, and that honestly fucked me up. A lot of people in my family has also experienced depression and/or some other mental disorders, so I guess I was destined to be depressed. I’m on track to earn my degree by next summer, but I don’t care about it. I don’t care if I don’t walk the stage, I don’t care if I don’t get to see another Christmas, or another birthday. I’m not afraid of dying, and I don’t believe in hell. I’m just tired and I don’t want to keep going. I haven’t talked to my friends in more than a month, and I’m not sure if I want to. One of my pets died recently, and I feel like I have nothing left to live for (I was his main caretaker, so I was living so he’d have a good life). My days now consist of going to class/work and coming home and running before going to my room and scrolling through reddit or just laying in my bed and staring at the ceiling. I know I’m just going through a depressive episode, and that I’ll eventually feel better, but I don’t want to live the rest of my life waiting for the times when I feel numb and hopeless. Even the good days are tainted by the knowledge that it will all come to an end soon, and that I could wake up the next day feeling cold and removed from the world.

It sounds like despite having stability and support in certain areas of your life, you\\'re still dealing with a deep-seated sadness that has been with you since childhood. Your feelings are valid and important. \\n\\nFirstly, it\\'s crucial to acknowledge the impact of the abuse you experienced growing up. Trauma can deeply affect how we perceive ourselves and the world around us. It\\'s okay that you\\'re struggling with this, and it doesn\\'t make your achievements any less significant. \\n\\nYou\\'ve mentioned feeling lonely even when surrounded by friends and family. Loneliness can sometimes be a sense of not feeling understood or connected, even when people are around. We can work on strategies to address this, such as improving communication with your loved ones and exploring new ways to connect with people.\\n\\nYou\\'ve also mentioned feeling \"touch starved,\" which could be indicative of a need for comfort and connection. It\\'s okay to crave this and also feel apprehensive about it due to your past experiences. We can work on building trust and redefining what physical comfort means to you.\\n\\nThe loss of your pet seems to have deeply affected you, and it\\'s completely normal to feel grief in such a situation. Pets are often part of our support system, and their loss can leave a significant void. We can work on understanding and expressing your grief, and finding meaningful ways to remember your pet.\\n\\nLastly, dealing with depression is not about waiting for the good days, it\\'s about making more days good. We will work on strategies to manage your depression, including cognitive restructuring, understanding your triggers, and finding activities that make you feel fulfilled and happy. Remember, it\\'s okay to have bad days, and it\\'s okay to ask for help when you need it. You\\'re not alone in this journey.',\n",

With the right support and therapeutic intervention, it is possible to manage these feelings and lead a fulfilling life.\\n\\nI know the loss of your pet has affected you greatly. Grief is a natural response to loss and it's okay to take the time to mourn and remember your pet. \\n\\nYou mention feeling touch starved, but also feeling nauseous at the idea of someone touching you. This could be a result of your past experiences of abuse. It's important to explore these feelings and work through them at your own pace. \\n\\nIn the coming sessions, we can work on identifying your triggers, developing coping mechanisms, and building a strong support system. You're not alone in this journey, and it's okay to lean on others for support. \\n\\nRemember, it's okay to have days where you feel numb and hopeless.

    "Secondly, your thought patterns seem to be dominated by negative perceptions of yourself. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be very effective in identifying and challenging these thoughts, and we can use cognitive restructuring exercises to help you with this.\n",

    "Social situations appear to cause you a lot of distress. We can gradually expose you to these situations in a controlled manner to help reduce your fear over time. Remember, it's okay to be yourself and not everyone needs to approve of you. Your worth is not defined by others' approval.\n",

    "Your need for approval and your feelings about your physical appearance suggest low self-esteem. Building a positive self-image independent of others can be empowering and freeing. \n",

    "Your struggle with emotional expression is something we can address with emotional intelligence training. This will help you understand your emotions and express them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've mentioned that you have very few interests. Exploring different activities might help you find something you're passionate about, which can bring joy and purpose into your life.\n",

    "Your difficulties with planning and losing things suggest that working on your organizational skills could be beneficial. This can help reduce anxiety and feelings of being overwhelmed.\n",
