      "You've expressed fear of social situations. Remember, it's okay to make mistakes in social interactions; they're part of the learning process. You can gradually build your social skills and confidence with practice. Mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing and meditation, could also help in managing anxiety in these situations.\n",

      "Your relationship with your parents, or the lack thereof, and your desire for a partner seem to be significant factors in your life. In therapy, we could explore how these relationships affect your self-perception and your interactions with others. It's okay to be careful about relationships, and we can work together on strategies to manage these fears.\n",

      "You've mentioned your difficulty with work and feeling guilty about not doing enough. It's crucial to remember that we all have limits, and it's okay not to be able to do everything. Exploring career options that align with your interests might make work more enjoyable and less stressful. Also, it's unrealistic and overwhelming to attempt to \"save the world.\" Instead, we can focus on identifying small, realistic ways for you to contribute positively to your environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of expressing your emotions, consider creative outlets like art, music, or writing. These can provide a non-verbal way to understand and express your feelings. Moreover, it's okay not to have many interests; however, you're encouraged to explore new hobbies or activities. Discovering something you enjoy can give you a sense of achievement and joy that doesn't depend on others' approval.\n",

      "Lastly, remember that a healthy relationship isn't just about physical attributes but mutual respect, understanding, and love. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to explore who you are and what you want from life at your own pace. Don't hesitate to seek help when needed - you're not alone in this journey.\n"
