        "txt": "i'm 17 years old, i have struggled with mental illness since childhood. i have been emotionally neglected by my parents as a child ( my mom partied, and brought men over all the time, and my dad is an alcoholic — both suffer from mental health issues ) my sister was the parent of me while she was just a teenager. she is 25 now and we are close, but she lives back home and i sometimes visit her. my parents separated before i was born. my mom had full custody and i’d visit my dad sometimes. ( i dont really visit anymore because he lives in another state ) he had met some girl when i was 7 who then became my step mom, she was nice sometimes but really immature and ALSO invalidated tf out of me. they fought in front of me as years went on ( domestic and verbal abuse towards each other ). they separated in 2023 and my dad is dating a guy now lol ( happy for him ). both my dad and my mom had a very bad childhood and they both struggle to understand me. when was doing bad my mom would emotionally abuse me and so would my dad ( i had to deal with my mom more because i lived with her — and still do ). my mom would curse at me, criticize me, make me believe everything was my fault, say she would send me to foster care, told me to kill myself, say i’m just like my dad, the list goes on. my dad isn’t and wasn’t as bad, but he had told me when i was doing bad one time that, “all you do is pop a few pills and go to your vacation spot” ( the mental hospital lol ). he has also told me to quite literally shut up when i was crying as a toddler. they are both better now, and try to understand me, but i’m still ill and i know that their abuse has left me traumatized. they had never hit me though, my mom would “pop” me when i was being bad/disrespectful, but i think that’s normal. i’m much closer with my dad on an emotional level even though i don’t even see him or call him much. last time i visited, i opened up to him a lot and he did not criticize me at all. i love him, and i love my mom too. i just don’t think me and my mom will have as much as a closer emotional bond like that because of how much she has invalidated, yelled, and blamed me for showing emotion. it’s like everything i do is a fuck up. like i said, she’s better now and learns to own up to her mistakes. she has literally came in my room and cried to me calling herself a bad mom, blaming herself because of why i am the way i am now. sometimes she understands me when i’m upset, but sometimes she still does her invalidating shit. thankfully, i’m emotionally mature enough to where i try not to let her words get to me, but they still sometimes do. because of my childhood where i was emotionally neglected and unheard, throughout my life, i’d attract people who were just really toxic towards me. my best friend in middle school was controlling, made me feel like shit, and traumatized me with her behavior. my relationships have ended because the person could not commit/was emotionally unavailable. i have both an anxious and avoidant attachment style. i had lost my first love recently who made my anxiety and worries go away, ( i am a lesbian ) and she left me because she had commitment issues, but also kind of did some shitty things to me to hurt me on purpose. i am finally starting to move on and still will always love her. i do believe i am a good person, and of course i’m not perfect, but i do believe i am fairly nice to people even when they do shitty things. i don’t know what i have, but i hope to get a diagnosis or something. i suspect autism, maybe ocd, or even both ( let me know if i really have to get into that ). one time when i was about 8/9 i tried to cut myself with a butter knife. after every minor inconvenience i’d think about not wanting to be here. around 14, ( during quarantine ) i randomly just decided that i would attempt suicide for the first time. after that, the attempts just kept happening every single age. ( 14,15,16,17 ) i’ve tried to kill myself by overdose of prescribed meds but it never worked. i’m scared of dying so, honestly part of it was probably for attention, but the other half of me actually just wanted life to be over. like, if it didn’t work, i hope people would pay attention to me. i had lost friends around 14 when i attempted ( pushed them away bc of my mental health issues ), which i can understand their pov. at the time, it was draining to be around me. now, i just keep to myself. and, i will admit, i’m more emotionally mature than an average adult. but i don’t know why, after everything, ( countless hospitals, med changes, support from multiple therapists, friends, family, psychiatrists ) i still just don’t want to be here. when things go wrong or im overwhelmed i uncontrollably hit and punch myself. i used to cut myself when i was 14-15, but i don’t like it anymore. sure, i’ve had moments where i DO enjoy being alive and love everything, but most of the time i literally just cannot. i know it’s getting bad again because i don’t even enjoy being around my friends anymore, i don’t like going to school, i don’t like anything. i just cannot kill myself bc im scared of going to a stupid mental hospital again and sitting days in the regular hospital smelling like shit bc they don’t have showers waiting to get admitted to the psychiatric hospital. it sucks feeling like literally nobody understands you, even though you have support. i’m very stuck and tbh the thing i wish for the most is just some disaster to happen to me that will kill me ( ie get murdered or something ) i take latuda, lamictal, abilify, and buspar ( and hydroxyzine as needed to help with my anxiety ) and they have helped, i think. but as of recently, they aren’t really helping lol. i have a therapist, and i have a psychiatrist. this isn’t a vent, this is me wanting help because i have no idea what to do. i want to live, i want to be happy, i want to look forward to my future and be a psychiatrist, and i want to be able to not shut down during stressful situations. i want to know what’s wrong with me. don’t say “nothing is wrong with you, you’re just human” because ive heard that quite a lot. i know i’m human, and i know it’s normal to feel these emotions. i know there are other people out there like me, and i know there are people who have given up. i know what depression and anxiety are, but i know that there has to be some kind of diagnosis for me. that’s all i want is to be aware of what could be wrong with me so i can be aware and get on meds that usually help with the diagnosis. i WANT to LIVE. i WANT to LIKE being around my friends again. i WANT to do good in school. senior year i am getting homeschooled and moving to another city in my state, so i’m pretty happy about that. i’m just worried i’ll drift apart from my friends and get fomo. just please, anyone, give me answers. help me and give me guidance to not feel like this anymore. IVE TRIED EVERYTHING. no coping skills work, so i dont want to hear “look into coping skills” mind you, i have been hospitalized 10 times, i know ALL about coping skills and breathing exercises. i know i typed a hell of a lot, but i hope whoever reads this will just say something. i want to be heard, and i want some answers so i don’t go through with another suicide attempt. thank you\n\n\nUpvote\n3\n\nDownvote\n\n2\ncomments\n\nShare",

Particularly with regards to my emotional expression, I feel I don’t have emotions socially, or they’re not appropriate. I’m awkward and really want the approval of others to know I’m doing okay and they like me. I don’t care who it’s from. I don’t want friends, I just want approval. However I deny myself it because it feels narcissistic, so I’m just quiet. I don’t want to be burdensome. I have no relationship with my parents. I don’t want to fall in love with anyone who’s not my partner because I don’t want to ruin it when it finally happens, I want to save myself for it. However I have never had a partner and may not for many years due to reasons I don’t know. However having a partner is the most important thing in life to me, yet I’m shallow enough to care a lot about their physical appearance.\n\nI have very few real interests or interest in doing things that don’t involve women or thinking about myself or or approval. Other people feel so much more real than me, like real humans with real interests and issues. Everything is so dry to me. Unless it involves socialising and then it’s scary. Even porn is starting to be dull. I like music and some films, and old youtube stuff. I’m constantly trying to find out what’s wrong with me and constantly making posts like these, almost obsessionally.\n\nI feel very dumb with regards to real world things, like freakishly unobservational and impulsive. It means I almost crash my car a lot, and get lost and lose things all the time. I hate to plan out things, it feels bad.\n\nDoing work or anything mildly cumbersome feels horrible as fuck until i get into ‘work mode’,.\n\nSo I’m just existing basically. And I feel guilty about it. I feel guilty about not being a better person, like I should be saving the world or something, yet at the same time I have no real interest in doing so and it’s painful to work.\n",

I'm terrified.\n\nI've been judged, I've been told I'm dramatic but do they know what's it's like for every dream they have to be a nightmare, to wake up in a panic not only from the fear of these vivid dreams but from the fear of complete uncertainty, to wake up with a body that is weak and sore from the aching, the tension, your heart pounding in your chest, and your mind already racing with every thought you could imagine of what horrible thing is gonna happen to you that day. \n\nDo they know what it's like to be scared to even move, to look around your room and feel detached from all of the very things that are supposed make you feel safe, to feel completely isolated even when people are just a few feet away.\n\nDo they understand what it's like to walk through the world with the constant feeling of someone sneaking up behind you, to never feel safe no matter where you are. \n\nEven now, I can feel the 'pins and needles' digging into my skin, it feels like I'm on fire, and the panic is setting in, the thought circling in my head \"I'm not okay\" \"I'm not okay\" \"I'm not okay\"\n\n'I'm scared\", \"I'm scared\", I\"'m scared\", \"I'm scared', \"I'm scared\". \n\nI can't talk to the people I trust because I don't want to be a burden, I don't want to bother them with my anxiety. \n\nImagine going to work feeling like this, driving, eating, trying to sleep, going to the park, the gym, out with friends, everyday, every night, it never stops. \n\nI'm so tired.."
