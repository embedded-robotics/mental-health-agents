        "txt": "i'm 17 years old, i have struggled with mental illness since childhood. i have been emotionally neglected by my parents as a child ( my mom partied, and brought men over all the time, and my dad is an alcoholic — both suffer from mental health issues ) my sister was the parent of me while she was just a teenager. she is 25 now and we are close, but she lives back home and i sometimes visit her. my parents separated before i was born. my mom had full custody and i’d visit my dad sometimes. ( i dont really visit anymore because he lives in another state ) he had met some girl when i was 7 who then became my step mom, she was nice sometimes but really immature and ALSO invalidated tf out of me. they fought in front of me as years went on ( domestic and verbal abuse towards each other ). they separated in 2023 and my dad is dating a guy now lol ( happy for him ). both my dad and my mom had a very bad childhood and they both struggle to understand me. when was doing bad my mom would emotionally abuse me and so would my dad ( i had to deal with my mom more because i lived with her — and still do ). my mom would curse at me, criticize me, make me believe everything was my fault, say she would send me to foster care, told me to kill myself, say i’m just like my dad, the list goes on. my dad isn’t and wasn’t as bad, but he had told me when i was doing bad one time that, “all you do is pop a few pills and go to your vacation spot” ( the mental hospital lol ). he has also told me to quite literally shut up when i was crying as a toddler. they are both better now, and try to understand me, but i’m still ill and i know that their abuse has left me traumatized. they had never hit me though, my mom would “pop” me when i was being bad/disrespectful, but i think that’s normal. i’m much closer with my dad on an emotional level even though i don’t even see him or call him much. last time i visited, i opened up to him a lot and he did not criticize me at all. i love him, and i love my mom too. i just don’t think me and my mom will have as much as a closer emotional bond like that because of how much she has invalidated, yelled, and blamed me for showing emotion. it’s like everything i do is a fuck up. like i said, she’s better now and learns to own up to her mistakes. she has literally came in my room and cried to me calling herself a bad mom, blaming herself because of why i am the way i am now. sometimes she understands me when i’m upset, but sometimes she still does her invalidating shit. thankfully, i’m emotionally mature enough to where i try not to let her words get to me, but they still sometimes do. because of my childhood where i was emotionally neglected and unheard, throughout my life, i’d attract people who were just really toxic towards me. my best friend in middle school was controlling, made me feel like shit, and traumatized me with her behavior. my relationships have ended because the person could not commit/was emotionally unavailable. i have both an anxious and avoidant attachment style. i had lost my first love recently who made my anxiety and worries go away, ( i am a lesbian ) and she left me because she had commitment issues, but also kind of did some shitty things to me to hurt me on purpose. i am finally starting to move on and still will always love her. i do believe i am a good person, and of course i’m not perfect, but i do believe i am fairly nice to people even when they do shitty things. i don’t know what i have, but i hope to get a diagnosis or something. i suspect autism, maybe ocd, or even both ( let me know if i really have to get into that ). one time when i was about 8/9 i tried to cut myself with a butter knife. after every minor inconvenience i’d think about not wanting to be here. around 14, ( during quarantine ) i randomly just decided that i would attempt suicide for the first time. after that, the attempts just kept happening every single age. ( 14,15,16,17 ) i’ve tried to kill myself by overdose of prescribed meds but it never worked. i’m scared of dying so, honestly part of it was probably for attention, but the other half of me actually just wanted life to be over. like, if it didn’t work, i hope people would pay attention to me. i had lost friends around 14 when i attempted ( pushed them away bc of my mental health issues ), which i can understand their pov. at the time, it was draining to be around me. now, i just keep to myself. and, i will admit, i’m more emotionally mature than an average adult. but i don’t know why, after everything, ( countless hospitals, med changes, support from multiple therapists, friends, family, psychiatrists ) i still just don’t want to be here. when things go wrong or im overwhelmed i uncontrollably hit and punch myself. i used to cut myself when i was 14-15, but i don’t like it anymore. sure, i’ve had moments where i DO enjoy being alive and love everything, but most of the time i literally just cannot. i know it’s getting bad again because i don’t even enjoy being around my friends anymore, i don’t like going to school, i don’t like anything. i just cannot kill myself bc im scared of going to a stupid mental hospital again and sitting days in the regular hospital smelling like shit bc they don’t have showers waiting to get admitted to the psychiatric hospital. it sucks feeling like literally nobody understands you, even though you have support. i’m very stuck and tbh the thing i wish for the most is just some disaster to happen to me that will kill me ( ie get murdered or something ) i take latuda, lamictal, abilify, and buspar ( and hydroxyzine as needed to help with my anxiety ) and they have helped, i think. but as of recently, they aren’t really helping lol. i have a therapist, and i have a psychiatrist. this isn’t a vent, this is me wanting help because i have no idea what to do. i want to live, i want to be happy, i want to look forward to my future and be a psychiatrist, and i want to be able to not shut down during stressful situations. i want to know what’s wrong with me. don’t say “nothing is wrong with you, you’re just human” because ive heard that quite a lot. i know i’m human, and i know it’s normal to feel these emotions. i know there are other people out there like me, and i know there are people who have given up. i know what depression and anxiety are, but i know that there has to be some kind of diagnosis for me. that’s all i want is to be aware of what could be wrong with me so i can be aware and get on meds that usually help with the diagnosis. i WANT to LIVE. i WANT to LIKE being around my friends again. i WANT to do good in school. senior year i am getting homeschooled and moving to another city in my state, so i’m pretty happy about that. i’m just worried i’ll drift apart from my friends and get fomo. just please, anyone, give me answers. help me and give me guidance to not feel like this anymore. IVE TRIED EVERYTHING. no coping skills work, so i dont want to hear “look into coping skills” mind you, i have been hospitalized 10 times, i know ALL about coping skills and breathing exercises. i know i typed a hell of a lot, but i hope whoever reads this will just say something. i want to be heard, and i want some answers so i don’t go through with another suicide attempt. thank you\n\n\nUpvote\n3\n\nDownvote\n\n2\ncomments\n\nShare",

But there are also lots of examples of folks who have successfully worked their way through this.  So there is hope!   In addition to the suggestion to visit your doctor (who may prescribe a medication to help you relax), there are many social service agencies who provide free counseling or take medicaid.  A good CBT therapist will help you look at your thinking so that you may see how you are distorting your thoughts.  Behavior is also important.  Despite how you may feel: it is helpful to go out, to do things that relax you (maybe a yoga class or a meditation class?).  Exercise. Diet. Eat well. Think back on the things that you used to do that helped in the past, and force yourself to do these things again.  I know that this seems hard, but it beats the alternative, doesn't it?  Of course, I recommend you pick up a copy of my book, Living Yes, which will help you look at these and other ideas to help you out.

I’m awkward and really want the approval of others to know I’m doing okay and they like me. I don’t care who it’s from. I don’t want friends, I just want approval. However I deny myself it because it feels narcissistic, so I’m just quiet. I don’t want to be burdensome. I have no relationship with my parents. I don’t want to fall in love with anyone who’s not my partner because I don’t want to ruin it when it finally happens, I want to save myself for it. However I have never had a partner and may not for many years due to reasons I don’t know. However having a partner is the most important thing in life to me, yet I’m shallow enough to care a lot about their physical appearance.\n\nI have very few real interests or interest in doing things that don’t involve women or thinking about myself or or approval. Other people feel so much more real than me, like real humans with real interests and issues. Everything is so dry to me. Unless it involves socialising and then it’s scary. Even porn is starting to be dull. I like music and some films, and old youtube stuff. I’m constantly trying to find out what’s wrong with me and constantly making posts like these, almost obsessionally.\n\nI feel very dumb with regards to real world things, like freakishly unobservational and impulsive. It means I almost crash my car a lot, and get lost and lose things all the time. I hate to plan out things, it feels bad.\n\nDoing work or anything mildly cumbersome feels horrible as fuck until i get into ‘work mode’,.\n\nSo I’m just existing basically.

Have you ever talked with a physician regarding your symptoms? Two extreme emotions such as feeling extremely happy and then feeling extremely low for a length of time may indicate a mood disorder. I think it would be best to talk with your doctor or a therapist to help pinpoint the issue causing them.It's possible that it could just be certain stressors in your life that are causing the two extremities but you definitely want to rule out any mental health issues.

                                "Night is hard for a lot of people, so you are definitely not alone here.  Has anything scary ever happened to you at night?  Answering that question may give you the \"why\" of where that's coming from.  If you haven't had a bad experience at night, it may just be the time when you have nothing to do, which allows more intense thoughts and feelings to surface.  Here's a couple things to try:One thing you could do is sit down a couple hours before you go to bed and journal (if you can).  Try to reduce any distractions and just go for it.  The purpose of this is to slow down well before you go to bed, expressing some of the anxiety from the day.  Also take note of the things you can tackle that day vs what can wait until later.  This gives your brain a chance to sort through some of the \"planning\" type of anxiety that commonly comes up when you are trying to sleep.Another thing you can do is make a list of the things you have control over.  Anxiety is really good at putting everything you feel out of control of on a giant metaphorical projection screen.  Try projecting some of the things you have control over instead.  For example--you have total control over breathing patterns, what you choose to wear the next day, what you pay attention to if you go for a walk, etc.  You also have control over how you personalize that list to what matters to you.  Mindfulness is a great way to focus on how you control your breath, and also how letting go of breathing doesn't stop your body from doing what it's always doing to keep you alive.  Any google search will bring up lots of information on this!Something to remember is that experiencing anxiety is OK.  It doesn't mean something is necessarily wrong.  Anxiety is sometimes just a feeling that comes up without much of a cause.  If you can't identify that cause, it's probably because of a little misinterpretation in the brain.  Mindfulness can definitely help with that."

Somehow the person was insufficiently nurtured and so felt  insecure when very young.Usually the person had to fend on at least a psychological and emotional level for themselves before reaching an age when doing so would have been reasonable.Their inner feeling of overwhelmed from when very young, hasn't faced the reality that the grown person is now capable, even if this takes some practice. Try asking yourself what you are afraid of and theorize how you would handle these situations as a grown person.Also, sometimes anxiety comes from feeling lonely.  This loneliness is reminiscent of the loneliness that the grown person now, felt when being left to take care of situations as a child which were too difficult and complex for any child to address."

                                "This is a very common question in my practice. Panic attacks typically emerge from an underlying issue (ex. Depression, low self-esteem, fears). To decrease your anxiety symptoms it’s recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable with.In my practice I educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety:1. Starting a daily mindfulness practice. For example: listening to guided meditation; engaging in deep breathing exercises; yoga practice; or other positive calming activities.2. Understand your negative and positive thoughts. Many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen. Increase positive self-talk when feeling down or when anxious. For example: \"I don't need to worry, I am calm and relaxed\". 3. Exposure to fearful or anxious situations. This can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional. Many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure. This may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do. For example: leaving the house; presenting in front of others; going to social events; and having conversations with people. However, the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills (ex. deep breathing) the chances of anxiety will decrease. I hope this was helpful. Keep in mind, a therapist can help with guiding you through self relaxation and improvement."

Chain analysis is a fantastic way for your to map out the situation starting with the prompting event, the chain of events ((links) that lead up to the behavior - in this case a panic attack, and then what the consequences were.  See the illustration below:This is very useful in that it lays everything out for you to see so that it becomes possible to alter one of the links leading up to the unwanted behavior (panic attack), allows you to come up with strategies for similar situations (prompting events) and allows you to understand how you are reinforcing the behavior when it does occur (consequences).  Finally - it would also allow you to identify any particular vulnerabilities, such as not enough sleep, poor nutrition, trauma history or having a cold the time it occurred.  Working with someone who utilizes a behavioral approach, such as DBT or behavioral analysis, you can find solutions that replace one of the links and therefore breaks the chain of events."

                                "The are two ways that such anxiety can be dealt with. One is an attempt to replace maladaptive thinking by examining the distorted thinking and resetting the fight-or-flight response with more reasonable, accurate ones. As an example \"I'm scared of spiders.\" But if you change the thinking from being scared to \"I'm bigger than the spider,\" it allows the mind to reach a calmer state of mind. Mindfulness-based therapy can also help  focus on the bodily sensations that arise when you feel anxious. Instead of avoiding or withdrawing from these feelings, remain present and fully experience the symptoms of anxiety. Instead of avoiding distressing thoughts, open up to them in an effort to realize and acknowledge that they are not literally true.Although it may seem counter-intuitive, fully realizing the experience of anxiety enables the release of over identification with negative thoughts. You can practice responding to disruptive thoughts, and letting these thoughts go.By remaining present in the body, you'll learn that the anxiety being experienced is merely a reaction to perceived threats. By positively responding to threatening events instead of being reactive you can overcome an erroneous fight-or-flight response."

Have you ever talked with a physician regarding your symptoms? Two extreme emotions such as feeling extremely happy and then feeling extremely low for a length of time may indicate a mood disorder. I think it would be best to talk with your doctor or a therapist to help pinpoint the issue causing them.It's possible that it could just be certain stressors in your life that are causing the two extremities but you definitely want to rule out any mental health issues. If it is in fact mental health related there are many medications or therapy choices that can help. Thanks for reaching out! I hope that you will feel back on track soon!"

Maybe even come up with a list of what that specific relationship did for you. After you say \"thank you\" to that relationship then it may be time to say goodbye. You obviously want to get over that person, so figure out why you want to get over them. Why did it not work out? What negative parts of the relationship do you keep forgetting to think about. Oftentimes, people glamorize the past. So for your goodbye part of this phase, I would focus on the negative parts of the relationship. You can also work on emotionally saying goodbye to that time in your life. You are probably different than you were 7 years ago, and to be honest, they are probably different too.I know it sounds weird.

                                "I really love that you're taking responsibility for your pessimism here. There's a modern parable about two young brothers. One child is in a room full of every toy you could imagine, and he's miserable; the other is in a room full of horse manure, and he's flinging it around with joy. So then someone comes and asks the first boy why he's so miserable, because he has so much. He says that he's missing the one toy that he really wants. Then the brother is asked why he's so happy in a room full of manure, and he says \"With all this sh-t, there's gotta be a pony in here somewhere!\"Happiness is a state of mind, and I hear you saying that you used to be happy, so maybe this means you believe it's possible. That's a wonderful start.Research on depression shows us that it is very linked to pessimism. You say \"I always see the worst end of things\". That's pessimism. Life is like an elephant. If all you see is roughness, backup and walk around; the view will change. The key to optimism is to build your ability to see the bad things in life as 1. temporary (this will pass. I know how to fix friendships), 2. Specific (not involving the whole of your life), and 3. not your fault (tons of people fail road tests). On the flip side, it helps if we can see good things as 1. more permanent, 2. bleeding into other areas of our lives, and 3. something YOU created. Not taking credit for good things and blaming yourself for the bad ones is typical especially of women. The feelings you are having are temporary; you're in a slump and it's a good time to sit down and look at how you can make the picture look different. I think you know how; but you lack energy right now. If tackling this on your own isn't enough, a therapist can help you take that step back to look at the big picture and help you rebuild your natural resilience and capacity for joy. I wish you the best."

If you're having difficulty sleeping, try to get into a habit of going to bed and waking up close to the same time every day. Also consider only using the bed for sleeping so your brain knows that it's time to sleep when you are in bed. If you are not sleeping while you are in bed, consider getting up and reading a book or doing something to make you tired before going back to bed. Hopefully you'll be able to establish a pattern.Sometimes sadness and other emotions make sleeping very difficult as well. Try keeping track of your moods to see what is leading up to the changes.If you're still struggling, consider talking with a therapist about the specifics and/or maybe talking with your primary care physician. There are natural sleep remedies that he or she may recommend for you."

I live in a posh village where not a lot happens and anyone who is a minority sticks out like a sore thumb. Me and my little brother were walking up to a zebra crossing and there was a car coming up to us very speedily, because of the speed the car was coming at I decided to wait to cross. However, my brother, even though I was holding his hand, did the extremely stupid thing of starting to cross. Out of sheer maternal instinct I was able to pull him back before he set foot into the road and this obviously spooked the driver and he abruptly stopped. I profusely apologised and we started crossing. After getting about halfway across the road the driver (a white man in his 40s) in the car behind the car who got spooked rolled his window down and started hurling swear words at me, like the most awful words. I wanted to shout back at him but all I could muster out is a pathetic “it wasn’t me”. To add to the embarrassment, we walked past on old white lady about 30 seconds after the incident and she scoffed at us very audibly. Rationalising it I know I did absolutely everything I could have done and since then me and my brother have been over road safety countless more times but I’m still frightened and embarrassed to set foot in my hometown as the place is extremely small. I’m away at university now and it’s been a couple of weeks since it happened, I go back home in a month and I’m extremely embarrassed. How do I get over this stupid fear?",

As a teen, you're developing your identity based on what feels right to you and what doesn't.  It's OK to be different than your friends, and just being around swearing doesn't mean you will for sure pick up that habit.  What is it that connects your anxiety to swearing?  If it feels like your automatic response might be to curse, you could try picking some words that don't go against your values to use as a default when you are upset.

Fears are sometimes irrational so that logic doesn't get rid of them.Think about whether you felt secure and confident as a child.  Also, did any major bad events happen to you with other people or situations when you were growing up?Often these overwhelming situations of childhood stay with us as fears of situations in our adult lives.  If the root of the problem w the fear is from long ago, then probably a therapist who can ask you questions which help you remember upsetting childhood circumstances, may help you to dissolve the current fear.Another possibility is CBT, cognitive behavior therapy which teaches people short term mantras to do something which is safe, say being a passenger in a commercial airplane, which feels frightening to a person.CBT is short term and results are limited to specific fears.

If it's more than a 5/10, I would definitely recommend talking with a therapist in your area.A lot of fears that we have come from something that at one time was self-protective and important. Do you know where your fear started? If you think it is still protecting you or helping you in some way, talk with someone (like a therapist) about it.If it is something that you know is irrational (for example, fear of being hurt by static cling from winter clothing), is there some part of that that you are not afraid of?I really encourage you to consider whether your fear has a lot of emotions connected to it or if it ties from something in your past that was very emotional for you at the time. If it does, consider working with a therapist to establish emotional safety before taking away the fear or anxiety that may actually be helpful to you.Also, the fact that you notice that you are afraid of something and you don't want to be afraid of it anymore is a big step in the forward direction."

Sometimes we come across something that scares us, we push through it and suddenly we aren't afraid anymore. But sometimes it can seem like our fears just take over and we cannot overcome them. There are some options:1. You can go to a counselor and receive some type of treatment. What kind of treatment would depend on the type of fears you are experiencing. For example, if you have a general phobia about something, they may use various techniques to help you manage it.  2. There are different websites and even some self-help books that you can use to try to overcome your fears. When it comes to overcoming certain fears or phobias, exposure therapy well-studied and proven to work. A therapist would help you with this, but some websites give instructions for how to do it yourself. I am not sure how well it works when you try it by yourself, but here is a link to a website that does offer some tools. http://psychology.tools/anxiety.htmlSome colleagues may offer you some other types of advice.

We would build a hierarchy of fears, that is a list of fears ranging from least to most, for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique, then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique, then moving closer to the bridge, then maybe standing on a bridge, all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing, until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge, or you can also engage in flooding which is for example, if you were scared of an elevator, go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore, in the movie Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne who has a great fear of bats, goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them. Secondly, look at your fears, do they even need to be worked on, some fears are healthy, for example if i was a therapist in New York City and someone came to me and said \"I'm scared of snakes\", I would probably say that is OK because there are very little snakes left in ManhattanHope that helps C"

For instance, let's say you are afraid of speaking in public. If your goal would be to one day speak to a room of people, you would start by creating a list of lesser fears that would eventually lead to the main fear of speaking in public. You could start your list with things that might be less anxiety-producing such as, asking for help at a store or speaking up in class or at work if something is bothering you. As you build-up to what you fear the most you will have taken baby steps while assessing whether or not what you feared most was as bad as you thought it would be. If it wasn't, that will help boost your confidence and help move you to the next step.

                                "Biologically, fear is designed to protect us from harm. Fear is not always a bad thing, and in fact can be quite healthy and appropriate depending on the situation. A phobia, however, is different. You used the term \"fear\" rather than \"phobia\". A phobia is an irrational fear - meaning it is not rational for you to fear that thing. If your situation is a phobia, exposure therapy can help. This consists of gradually exposing yourself a little at a time to the thing you are afraid of. Some people with phobias find that the irrational fear interferes with their life and they do need to overcome it. Someone who is afraid to drive over bridges may go to great lengths to avoid routes that have bridges. People who are afraid of elevators may always use the stairs instead, which may not always be feasible. If overcoming a phobia will improve the quality of your life, then by all means, seek professional help to overcome it.Everyone has fears, or things that make them nervous. Public speaking, asking a person out, fear of failure. Examine what your fear is and try to determine the reason for the fear. When you can get to the root cause of the fear, you can deal with that issue. A lot of times, it is a self-esteem issue. You may be able to peel back the layers of the fear and find out what's causing it and deal with the real issue. Some fears are caused by trauma. Someone with PTSD is going to have an exaggerated fear response and will find themselves being kicked into \"fight or flight\" mode over things that someone without the trauma experience wouldn't notice or react to. In cases like this, exposure therapy would be the wrong approach and could actually make things worse. If there is a possibility that a past trauma is the cause of your fear, I strongly urge you to seek a therapist - not just any therapist, but one who is trained to work with trauma and abuse victims."

We know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and self-blame, but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes? If you tune into your own thoughts, or your \"internal dialogue\", you'll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings. So people who are holding onto embarrassment and self-blame often have thoughts like, \"How could I do that?\", \"I looked so stupid!\" \"Now people saw things I did not want them to see!\" If we tune in more, we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible, horrible, and that we cannot deal with it. These are self-sabotaging thoughts that lead to shame, self-blame and embarrassment. If you look at the evidence, you can find more rational thoughts such as, \" We all make mistakes\", \"People can look all different ways at different time - this incident does not define me!\" and \"If someone has a bad image or thought about me, it is really OK! People have all kinds of thoughts about other people, and it does not have to be a major problem.\" When you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones, you will start to feel better, more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly."

We often times will focus on the negative and forget about the positive.  Next, you had an incident where someone pointed something out which may have caused embarrassment.  Whether or not it was malicious on his part I think the important thing to focus on is what is called \"Common Humanity\".  Common Humanity is one of the three elements of self-compassion.  Common humanity essentially recognizes that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience.  While you may have had this embarrassing moment at this time, that boy may have had an embarrassing moment another day.  We all have embarrassing moments.  When we recognize that we do not suffer in isolation then we are able to move past that suffering.  Additionally another element to self-compassion is self-kindness.  My question is why must you forgive yourself?  Rather, be kind to yourself for learning an amazing new talent."

If you are looking for commitment from this person, but you are seeing them casually, do they know and are they looking for commitment as well? What does being content and at peace with yourself mean? Have you dated yourself? There's a page that I point other single people to on instagram #dearfuturehim, check it out. This girl is all about what to do while you are waiting and single, she also talks about being content and the \"business of the brain\" when you're single.

Sometimes we can lose a sense of who we are because in a way we have become defined by the relationship itself.  So, when we begin to move on and see other people, our sense of identity may be obscured.  The tendency is to seek out validation to give us a feeling of worthiness.   That it's ok to move on and be happy.   This is a relatively normal reaction.  It's important to treat yourself with kindness and compassion through this time in your life.  Mindful self-compassion can be a great way to begin the process of getting that sense of who you are back and what you want in a relationship.  I think its important to look back, learn what you can from the previous relationship, and become a better person for it in the future.  At the same time, taking the necessary time to nuture yourself on a mind, body, and spirit level. Self-compassion allows you to turn inward and except all facets of who you are.  It improves your capacity for love, vulnerability, emotional openness, social interconnectedness, and self-respect.  My philosophy is holistic, collaborative, and accepting.  The cornerstone of my treatment philosophy is mindfulness and other evidenced based integrative modalities.  I work as your ally to help you cultivate abundant self-compassion in your life, so that you can have the types of relationships you want."

                                "It sounds to me like you would benefit from mindfulness practice and self-compassion practice. What is mindfulness?Mindfulness, in short, is the practice of bringing a non-judgmental awareness to the present moment. This meditative tradition stems from Buddhism and was brought to the West by Zen teachers who made them more accessible for Westerners. If you’ve ever taken a yoga class or played a guided meditation wherein you were encouraged to focus on your breath without changing it, feel the sensations on your skin and bring awareness to tension in your body, you’ve practiced mindfulness.What is self-compassion? We often hear about self-esteem as something we need to increase for optimal mental health. The problem with self-esteem is that it ebbs and flows based on external factors – such as if you have a good job or if you have a romantic relationship. A much better place to put your energy into is developing self-compassion, which is being kind to yourself no matter what your circumstances look like. Over time, self-compassion acts as the building blocks for self-love, which no one or nothing can take away from you. Why develop these practices? When you can practice mindfulness and self-compassion in tandem, then you bring more acceptance and understanding to your life circumstances instead of judging yourself for not having the perfect life. I hope this is helpful and I wish you all the best. If you’re interested in this type of approach a holistic therapist can help you learn these tools and put them into daily practice."

One of the ways to find peace within yourself could be to engage in life and find fulfillment in healthy experiences.. Theorist  Karen  Horney considered  this approach a form of therapy.  She taught that most  individuals could thrive once their fears and anxieties had been alleviated.

One is to re-invest in the friendships you have by setting up regular coffee get-togethers for example.  Two, get out in nature.  It's hard to ignore how grand and patient nature is, and it sometimes takes the pressure off what we should be and instead allows us to be.  And the last one I'll throw out there is to invest your time and energy in a project or achievement you've wanted to do for a while, but that perhaps you didn't have the time to.  Something related to a hobby such as sports or music, or related to your career.  Something that is 'for' you.  Life knocks us off balance at times, and that's ok.  Self-questioning during these times can be a healthy endeavor.  Should you follow any of the advice on this website, continue to be kind to yourself about what you're feeling, and curious about why you're feeling that way."

It is similar to fearing that we won't ever get a good job when we have been out of work for awhile or fearing that we won't be healthy when we have been sick. We fear these things because they are so important - not because these fears are realistic or true! There is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience, dating, etc. While some people may judge an adult who is a virgin - others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices. Experimenting with sex, so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal. Since expectations vary and we can't be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people, we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique, virgin or not. When we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness (not a real word but you get what I mean!) then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort - putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships. When you are most afraid of being alone - remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships. Use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be \"normal\" or whatever that is anyway. Hope this helps!"

                                "I think one of the first questions that springs to mind for me is, \"what's the rush?\"  Just because other people in your circle have had experiences that you are still warming up to does not mean that there's something wrong or something to be ashamed of.  If anything, I want to commend you on the self-respect you have in wanting to wait and share this most intimate of experiences with someone that will feel the same way about it.  One of the most common distortions in our thinking is when we try to directly compare ourselves to others; while these people and even those in your family share a level of closeness to you they are not exactly like you - they don't see or feel things in the exact same way as you nor do they share the exact same perspective. It's important to be making choices for you and for your own desires and life goals.  Once you stop comparing your happiness, you may find that you are already experiencing it and allow more of your guard to fall down."

There is another relatively inexpensive 4 yr college within commuting distance that I would like to attend, I have a lot of gen ed credits that would transfer to the degree I want (the cc has a transfer agreement with the 4 yr college). I only need 7 more classes which will be spread between summer term and fall term (4 classes one semester and 3 the next), my usual workload is 5-7 classes. I’d like to go ahead and get started on my Bachelors in the Fall, but I still want to get my AAS degree from my other school. Is it legal to be enrolled in two colleges at once? Or do I have to finish my AAS before enrolling at the other college? I’ve tried to look for information about it but nothing is really clear, I’m also the first person in my entire family to go to college, so I don’t really know how the college system works. I also tried to ask my academic advisor and the transfer advisors, but they either didn’t understand the question or didn’t know the answer."

My ex-boyfriend is trying to help but is making things worse because every time I see or hear him, I break down into tears. I found out that I will never be promoted now because of my depression.",

Often, we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems (stress, social anxieties, etc.) for our depression, but the truth is that depression requires it's own little tool kit. Depression is all-encompassing, and, based on what you've written, the symptoms are already affecting work and your personal life in myriad ways.  The best route forward would be to seek out counselling, admittedly, but if your insurance deductible is too high, that can be very expensive. I would recommend contacting your Employee Assistance Program (EAP) if offered by your employer. If not, you can look into community centres for counselling options, check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization. If, however, you are motivated to get your depression under control, there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist (as long as your therapist is trained in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, or CBT), such as \"Mind Over Mood\"."

                                "Frequently when working with clients, I utilize the A-B-C model developed by Albert Ellis, the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Theory. The theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event. For instance here is an example:A (Action or Event): You need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you back.B (Behavior or Response): You begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or I am not important to this person.C (Consequence): You feel depressed.If you look at the model, B has a direct effect on C. The thought is if you change your reaction to A, then C will have a better consequence, such as:A: stays the same.B (this is what you change): This person must be busy, they will call me back when they get a chance or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is available.C: Decreased feelings of depression & overall functioning improves.This is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior, studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve. If this model resonates with you, I recommend \"Feeling better, getting better, staying better\" by Alber Ellis. In addition, looking for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling abandoned or alone."

First and foremost, know that you cannot fix this for him, and get support for yourself.As much as you are able, make space in your relationship for him to talk about what he is experiencing.  He might not want to talk, and that is ok.If he wants to talk, try to listen without judgement and without trying to talk him out of his feelings.  Focus on validating his feelings and just sitting with him in his pain.Let him know how you feel...that you love him, that you care, that you are concerned, that this is scary for you too, that you are here.I hope that this is helpful.

And unless they address this message from their soul, accompany a guide on a journey to discover their own missing information, that is to recognize how their own uncomforted emotional pain has resulted in a coping stategy which has effectively cut themselves off from their own beauty, their Self, and their ability to receive love from themselves and others. Their attempt to kill themselves is a cry from their soul or spirit that they cannot live the life they are living any longer.  They take this literally and try to end their life, when in fact what their soul or spirit is saying is they need to begin to live the life they came here to live."

Perhaps he can tell you about what is different so that you may know him would be most helpful to him.I also hope that you husband is still continuing with his own treatment.There may also be a local peer support telephone number for the county that you live in that they be able to help you determine whether your husband needs more immediate treatment if he is feeling hopeless again.

Even if you decide against immediately telling him how you're feeling, knowing this about yourself will guide how and the topics you bring up with him.Is your husband talking easily with you?Do you have some ideas as to what is creating his feeling of hopelessness?The ideal approach would be if the two of you are able to discuss what bothers him and what bothers you.Depending on how far away you each are from such a position, you may benefit from speaking with a licensed professional therapist who can guide you and or you and your husband on opening up for discussion what feels stressful enough to merit taking one's own life."

While he was hospitalized, and prior to his release, your husband would've been provided in writing a self-care action plan. This typically includes things like committing to a contract 'not to harm' and what to do if he felt overwhelmed by his anger, depression, and hopelessness (e.g. call 911, call therapist, go to nearest hospital emergency department). Additionally, his protocol would've provided instructions for his taking medication(s) as directed, having a follow-up appointment(s) with his psychiatrist/psychologist/clinical social worker, and participating in some form of small group support.  If your husband's struggling as you describe, and you are feeling overwhelmed or frightened for his (your) safety, I'd encourage you to seek immediate assistance."

I imagine that you must be going through your own difficult time too. You've had a complicated shock and trauma in your life and in your marriage; it's normal for both of your emotions to move from hope to despair to fear, anger, gratitude... there is no wrong way to feel and there is no particular pattern your emotions or his will follow. Try not to assume what he is feeling but ask him instead. \"How are you doing today?\" is something that can be asked over and over again and your love and compassion for him will come through. If he has a hard time talking, you can share your observations. \"I notice you're more withdrawn. This worries me.\" Certainly it will help you if you know what he's thinking and feeling because he hid his intentions to hurt himself. It's normal that you want to know. If there is depression and hopelessness, this likely was part of what led to his initial despair. There is help out there. Depression is treatable, and seeking that treatment is important right now at this vulnerable time. This is the kind of complex situation that can be assisted by a therapist who is qualified to help you both understand and manage your emotions. Whether your husband seeks help or not, I hope that you do."

I don't mean to scare you but I do want to be realistic with you. If a person attempts suicide once it is more likely they will try again. Men also succeed more often than women because they typically use a means that is more fatal. Here are some signs you can watch for:Threatening to hurt or kill himself, or talking of wanting to hurt or kill himself; and or,Looking for ways to kill himself by seeking access to firearms, available pills, or other means; and/or,Talking or writing about death, dying or suicide, when these actions are out of the ordinary. Some other signs are:Increased substance (alcohol or drug) useNo reason for living; no sense of purpose in lifeAnxiety, agitation, unable to sleep or sleeping all of the timeFeeling trapped – like there’s no way outHopelessnessWithdrawal from friends, family and societyRage, uncontrolled anger, seeking revengeActing reckless or engaging in risky activities, seemingly without thinkingDramatic mood changesGiving away prized possessions or seeking long-term care for petsNow, in terms of ways you can help: 1. Ask if your husband is okay or if he is having thoughts of suicide2. Express your concern about what you are observing in his behavior3. Listen attentively and non-judgmentally4. Reflect what he shares and let him know that his is heard5. Tell him he is not alone6. Discuss treatments available that can help7.

                                "A failed suicide attempt is commonly thought of as a “cry for help,” however it can also be a serious attempt to find a permanent solution to depression, hopelessness or other feelings a person feels are unbearable. It’s wonderful that you want to support your husband, but If your husband is feeling depressed and hopeless, you can best help him by getting him to a mental health professional. Feelings of hopelessness and depression, and previous attempts at suicide are all risk factors for future suicide attempts. With a mental health professional, or in the emergency room of a hospital, your husband should be evaluated for suicidal thoughts, intent and plan, and if he is a danger to himself he should probably be hospitalized again until he is stable. Without knowing the particulars, your husband may suffer from Major Depressive Disorder or some other illness on the depressive spectrum. In that case medication could help him immensely, at which point you can offer your support and encouragement him to practice gentle self-care. And do not forget to practice it for yourself.  Remember: a suicide attempt not only affects the person, but it is an immense stressor for his or her loved ones as well. As they say, “put your oxygen mask on first.” Then you will be better able to provide your husband with calm and loving care and attention.Kayla Schwartz, LMSW[email protected]"

                                "What a heavy situation to be in.  It must be really hard to feel like you aren't able to help your son and the help you do try to give isn't truly helping him or you.  There's some things in this situation that are out of your control--what your son does, if he takes help or doesn't, and the feelings that come up for you about that.  I can only imagine how draining it would be as a parent to be unable to change something so important.  It makes sense you'd be feeling anxious and depressed.Let's switch for a minute to the things you have total control over--what are those things in this situation?  Maybe that's how you express your love for your son.  Or maybe it's how you choose to support him (even if it feels like it's a betrayal to him).  Pay attention as well to the amount of worry you experience--how much of that helps you plan vs how much of that is excess?  Knowing what worry isn't necessary can help to put you in control of how you spend some of your time.  You can replace this time with some self-care instead, giving back to yourself.Finding support groups or people that have similar situations can be very helpful. I'd say they are almost necessary.  Knowing other people get what you are going through and understand the emotional toll can be somewhat healing.  They may also know other resources or ideas you can try that are available to people in your situation.Something else to consider is grief work.  Letting go of some or all of the situation with your son (if that's what it comes down to) is a giant loss.  You probably already went through losing who your son was before the addiction, so it could be worth exploring the impact that had and has on you."

While I would suggest that you don't really know what he or his family are thinking or feeling (you assume they're against you, and that he doesn't care), he is certainly behaving in a very distant, excluding manner and it's understandable that you would feel rejected and hurt.

You mentioned doing \"stupid things to yourself\", and I don't know what that means. If you are engaging in self-harm he may be confused about what to do and he might need some time to think and be separate but is having trouble talking about this. Part of the problem, of course, is that you don't know what's going on for him. Certainly, you deserve the truth, and if he doesn't want to spend time with you, I would hope he would be honest. Have you been open to hearing the truth from him? Is there any reason for him to hesitate to tell you why he's being distant? Maybe you could ask him, if you are ready to hear.I'm glad to hear that you believe that you deserve a full, loving relationship, although it seems that moving forward might be difficult for you. Is it possible your happiness is a bit too dependant on this man? I'm just guessing, based on what you've said here.  It seems that it's possible your situation has led to some depression, and I would recommend a session with a qualified therapist to help you sort this out. You will need support, even if the relationship is repaired. Best of luck."

I feel like I just shouldn't be here and wish I wouldn't have been born so I didn't have to go through life. For me, it's a chore, but I don't know if that's normal or a sign of something.",

Inside you are the only one who will feel when you discover the true answer to your question.Everyone feels some amount of discontent in their lives once in a while. Its normal to not feel entirely happy all the time.Try to accept your unhappiness as motivation to learn more about who you are, what you like, whom you like.Study yourself bc this way you increase the chance to find a road which feels right and happy."
