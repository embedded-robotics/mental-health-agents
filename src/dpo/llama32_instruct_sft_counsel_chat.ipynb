      "Hi, It sounds like you are very frustrated with your own performance and your girlfriend's desire to have sex with other men. First, let me say that it is completely understandable that you would be frustrated. You are not alone in this, and many people feel the same way. I would suggest that you take a step back and try to understand where your frustration comes from. Are you feeling rejected? Are you feeling angry? Are you feeling sad? If you are feeling rejected, then this may be a reason to talk with your girlfriend about this. If you are feeling angry, then you may want to talk with your girlfriend about this. If you are feeling sad, then you may want to talk with your girlfriend about this. I would also suggest that you talk to a therapist about your own feelings and frustration. I would be very concerned if you are feeling rejected. It is possible that you are feeling rejected because you feel that you are not good enough. I would suggest that you talk with a therapist about this so that you can get to the bottom of this. I would also suggest that you talk to your girlfriend about this. I would suggest that you be patient and understanding of her feelings. She may be feeling rejected or sad because of your erectile dysfunction. You may also want to talk with her about the fact that you are not interested in having sex with her. I would suggest that you be honest with her and be clear about your feelings. I would also suggest that you be patient and understanding of her feelings. It is possible that she has feelings of anger or frustration, and talking with her about this may help to resolve this. I would also suggest that you talk to a therapist about your own feelings and frustration. It may be helpful to talk with a therapist about this so that you can get to the bottom of this.\n",

      "For the past week or so me and my boyfriend have been fighting. He has been making a lot of bad choices and he is currently hospitalized. I'm barely eating or sleeping because I'm constantly worried about him. Everyone else in my life says that I should just forget about him and walk away. What should I do? How do I choose the right path with my boyfriend?\n",

      "First of all, I want to commend you for your compassion and concern for your boyfriend. I'm sure he is very worried about you too. It is a great sign that you are thinking about him and that you are aware of the impact his actions may have on you. It is also important to recognize that you can't control his actions, but you can control how you respond to them. You can't force him to make better choices, but you can decide whether or not you are willing to continue in a relationship with him. I would encourage you to think about what your priorities are. Are you more concerned about his well being than you are about your own well being? If you are, then it may be time to start thinking about whether or not you want to continue the relationship. If you are not, then you may want to start thinking about what you want for yourself and how you can set boundaries with him. It may also be helpful to consider whether or not you can trust him to make good choices. If you feel that you can't trust him, then it may be time to start looking for someone else. I hope this was helpful and I wish you the best.\n",

      "I am in high school and have been facing anxiety issues lately. Whenever I get close to being in a relationship, some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship. This anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit. While a semi-relationship should be joyous, for me, it's an emotional nightmare I can't get to the bottom of. I've had this before and had to leave the semi-relationship to avoid throwing up every time I made contact with my crush. What could be the reason behind this? Is it massive nerve problems? Is it a fear of a bad relationship?  While I'm not quite ready to be in one anyway, I want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which I can be in one. I don't take medications and have no desire to, I have read forums, and I've talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems. Relationships cause me anxiety and nausea\n",

      "Hi, I'm so glad you reached out! I'm sure there's a lot of anxiety that's swirling around in your mind and I can imagine how overwhelming it must be. First of all, let me tell you that it's okay to have anxiety and it's okay to not have it. In fact, I think that's a sign of a healthy and functioning brain. Anxiety is just a part of life, and it's something that we all experience to some degree. I'm not sure if it's \"massive nerve problems\" that are causing this, but if it is, then you may want to talk with your doctor about that. Anxiety can be related to a variety of things, so I'd be curious to know more about what's going on for you. Have you ever had a similar experience in the past? If you have, then you may want to think about what that was like and how it relates to the current anxiety you're experiencing. I also want to ask you some questions, but please keep in mind that I'm not a doctor, so if you are experiencing severe symptoms, please seek help from a qualified professional. What are some of the things that you enjoy doing? What are some of the things that you are good at? What are some things that you enjoy talking about? What are some things that you are passionate about? What are some things that you are good at? What are some things that you are good at? What are some things that you enjoy talking about?

      "I'm concerned about my boyfriend. I suffer from anxiety, but I always have this feeling he wants to hurt me because he told me he was interested in BDSM intercourse. We haven't tried it, but I've had this feeling he always wants to. I'm scared because my boyfriend is interested in BDSM\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's understandable that you're concerned about your boyfriend's interest in BDSM, especially if you've never tried it. BDSM can be a very intense experience, and there's a lot of pressure to perform. If your boyfriend is interested in BDSM, it may be a good idea to talk to him about what he's looking for in terms of BDSM. If you're not interested, then he may not feel as pressured to continue trying it. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns and what you're looking for in a relationship.\n",

      "I'm a Christian teenage girl, and I have lost my virginity. My boyfriend is a Christian teenager too, but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner. I planned to abstain from sex but I guess I wasn't clear about this because I was also tempted and led him on. We continued to have sex. Does it mean that he isn't the one God planned for me? We're so young, but that doesn't stop me from dreaming of a potential future together. I really do feel like he is in my life for an important reason. I'm incredibly happy for I was able to escape from several abusive relationships because of him. I love him very much. Does it mean that he isn't the one God planned for me if we had sex as Christians?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm glad you are looking at this from a place of seeking your own truth, not necessarily what God says. It sounds like you have been in a situation where you were not in control, and that can be really difficult to work through. The good news is that you have been able to escape abusive relationships. This is a huge accomplishment and I would encourage you to give yourself credit for that. The bad news is that you were able to engage in sexual activity with someone who is not the one God planned for you. I'm sure that you have been thinking about this a lot and it's a lot to process. I would encourage you to seek out a trusted counselor who can help you to work through these feelings and thoughts. I wish you the best.\n",

How can I get away from my phone?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend that you try to identify what triggers your desire to use your phone. Is it to avoid stress? To cope with an emotional issue? To be connected with others? Once you have identified the trigger, then you will be able to find alternative ways of coping with the stress or emotional issue that you are trying to avoid.\n",

He claimed he was sober, but since we've split, I've heard many lies from him. Could he be using again, and does this addiction affect the mind? I don't know if my ex-boyfriend is using opiates again\n",

      "\n",
      "Hi, I'm so sorry to hear that you have been hurt by your boyfriend's lies. Unfortunately, addiction is a disease that affects the mind and body. If your boyfriend is using again, he will need to seek treatment for his addiction. I am not sure how old he is, but addiction can happen at any age. It is a disease that affects the brain, so he will need to address the physical and psychological aspects of his addiction in order to recover. I hope you are able to get some support and guidance from a counselor or therapist. It sounds like you have been hurt, and you may be able to learn a lot about yourself and how to cope with the pain of being in an abusive relationship by working with a therapist. I hope you are able to find some healing and support.\n",

      "My therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here. However, my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends.

I knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me, but this therapist dropped me off and never came again.

      "Hello. I'm so sorry that you are feeling this way. It sounds like you have been feeling confused and betrayed by your therapist for a long time. I can imagine that it is very hard to trust someone, especially when you have been doing good for them. I'm also sorry that you have been paying him back money over and over again. It sounds like you are very clear that you want to be done with this relationship. I would recommend that you take some time to reflect on what you want for yourself. Are you happy with the type of therapist you are working with? Do you want to continue to see him? Do you want to continue to pay him money? I would also recommend that you take some time to reflect on what led up to this situation. It sounds like you were in a state of high stress and possibly under the influence of medications. It's possible that he may have been taking advantage of you or taking advantage of you in other ways. It's also possible that you were not thinking clearly at the time and did not realize what was happening. Whatever the reason, it's possible that you may have been taken advantage of and that's why you are feeling confused and betrayed. I would recommend that you seek out another therapist who will be a better fit for you. I would also recommend that you seek out a therapist who is not gay. I know this may be hard to hear, but I believe that it's possible that your therapist may have been using his sexual orientation as a way to manipulate you. I would recommend that you seek out a therapist who will respect you and your boundaries. I wish you the best.\n",

      "I'm sorry to hear that you are going through such a tough time. It sounds like your wife is not very understanding and is being very controlling and manipulative. I would suggest that you seek legal advice. If you are not receiving a fair settlement, you may want to consider filing a civil lawsuit against her. If you are not getting a fair settlement, this is something that you can address with your lawyer. I would also suggest that you seek counseling to help you deal with the emotional impact of your divorce. I hope that you will find a way to move forward from this difficult time.\n",

      "I'm sorry to hear that you and your daughter are going through this difficult time. Breaking the news to the family will be a difficult task. It's important to do this in a way that is sensitive to all of them. I would suggest that you have a conversation with your daughter first. Let her know that you are worried about her and that you want her to know the truth about what is going on. Let her know that you are not trying to be cruel, but that you want her to know the truth. It may be difficult for her to hear, but it is important for her to know what is going on. Then you can have a conversation with the rest of the family about it. I would suggest that you not say anything in front of them, but rather have a conversation with them about the topic. You may be able to get some insight or support from them. It's important to remember that everyone has different ways of coping with this situation. Some people may need to be told what is going on, while others may not. If you have a child or grandchild who has gone through something similar, they may be able to offer some insight or support. I wish you the best of luck.\n",

Is it something else? You say you hate it, but I also sense that you love it. Maybe you are just not seeing the good parts. Maybe you are not getting the support you need from your boss.

      "My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year's resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on boardâ€”no more drinking every night. The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleepâ€”it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard. My husband was lying about drinking again\n",

      "Hi, and thank you for your question. I understand that you are concerned about your husband's drinking and that you are worried about the potential negative consequences of his drinking, such as his health, his relationships with others, and your own emotional well-being. I also understand that you are worried about the potential consequences of your husband's drinking, which is his safety, his relationships, and your own safety. It is a difficult situation to navigate, and it is understandable that you are feeling a little overwhelmed. I would suggest that you take a step back and look at the facts. If your husband is lying to you, then that is a problem. If he is lying about his drinking, then that is a problem. But if you are feeling overwhelmed and unsure about how to respond, then I would suggest that you take a break from the situation and do not engage in the behavior that you know is not healthy for you. It is important to communicate with your husband in a way that is respectful and non-accusatory. This means that you should avoid blaming or criticizing him, and instead focus on expressing your own feelings and needs. I would suggest that you say something like, \"I feel worried and scared about your drinking, and I would like to know what is going on. Is everything okay? Can we talk about this?\" This will help him to feel heard and understood, and it will also give you a chance to express your own feelings and needs. It is also important to remember that you can never know for sure what is going on in your husband's life, and that you should not assume that he is lying to you. You can only know for sure what is going on if he chooses to tell you. But you can be sure that if he is lying, then he is not going to come clean with you.

      "My wife and I have a great relationship except for our sex lives. We are pretty transparent and honest, and basically, she feels bad because she never wants to have sex. She doesn't have the desire. She's also never orgasmed. She feels like a terrible wife and fears I'll cheat on her. She doesn't know why. Last time we had sex, she cried and felt bad and didn't know why she cried. However, she also told me that the last time we had sex, she felt me in her, but it just felt \"ehh\" and wanted to stop. That makes me feel really awful. We rarely have foreplay. Everything I try tickles her, so she makes me stop. We are both frustrated but very much in love. She and I are in our early 20s. We're married and we have a baby on the way. My wife doesn't want to have sex\n",

      "A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time. We talked for hours and she told me time and again that I was a great guy. She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality, etc. I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning. Now, though, I can't stop thinking about her, but I leave to go back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her. So now I feel constantly depressed because even if I told her how I felt it wouldn't matter. I feel helpless and I don't know what to do. I'm a 19 year old male with low self esteem. I've always been very closed off about my feelings and problems\n",

      "Hi, and thank you for your question. It sounds like you are dealing with a great deal of self-doubt, and it is a common problem for young people, especially men, to feel insecure about themselves. It is not uncommon for people to go through this phase of their lives, especially during the transition from high school to college. It sounds like you are going through this phase right now, and it is a normal part of growing up. I would encourage you to keep an open mind and not to put too much pressure on yourself. It is okay to feel insecure, and it is okay to make mistakes. It is also okay to not be the \"best\" at something. I would encourage you to remind yourself of your strengths and accomplishments, and to focus on the things that you enjoy doing. I would also encourage you to seek out people that are supportive of you and who can help you to feel more confident. It is also important to seek out professional help if you are struggling with low self-esteem. It can be helpful to have a professional to talk to if you are feeling overwhelmed or struggling with self-doubt. I wish you the best of luck.\n",

They may be able to provide you with some free or low-cost counseling services. I hope this was helpful. I wish you the best of luck.\n",

      "About 5 months ago my ex left without fully explaining why. For me it seemed out of the blue. I don't miss her as much as I used to but I just don't trust people anymore, not even my friends who I have known since my childhood not even my family. I'm so terrified of being judged or dismissed. Instead of acting like someone else or putting on a mask of a personality, I've just shut down. I haven't felt that sense of comfort and happiness with myself since everything fell apart. I'm scared to because I don't want it to be taken away from me again. I feel like ever lesson I learn only last a day. I just don't know what to do. I'm working at a place I know I should enjoy. I'm keeping up with my creative passions: working out, eating healthy, etc. I'm doing everything the books say I should do, but I don't feel any different. I just don't know what to do. My ex left without fully explaining but I feel broken and empty\n",

      "I don't think it's healthy to embarrass a child as punishment. Punishment is intended to teach us what we are doing wrong. Punishment is meant to be an unpleasant experience. It's not meant to be painful or to make us feel bad about ourselves. Punishment can also be very confusing for children. I think that if the step-mother is not feeling her way to communicate with her grandson about why she's doing this, then maybe she should talk to him about it in a way that's more appropriate. Punishment is not an effective way to teach children. It's not only painful, it's also not effective. It can create feelings of resentment and anger in children. It's a very poor way to teach children about what they did wrong and how to correct it. It's not only ineffective, it's also a very poor way to teach children.

It's hard to say what the answer is, but I can tell you that there are many different ways to get out of a relationship, and it sounds like you are stuck on the idea that you want to be with him. You may want to consider having a conversation with him about what you want from a relationship and what you are willing and not willing to do.

It is also possible that your friends are not aware of the way you are feeling and that they are not aware of how their words are being received by you. The best way to know for sure is to talk with each of them individually and to ask them if they are feeling attacked and if they have any suggestions for how to handle the situation.

We are both 22 years old and we have been together for two and a half years. We are in a long distance relationship, so we are not able to meet up in person. We are able to talk with each other on the phone and I've been able to learn a lot about what makes him happy and what makes him sad. He's a great person and I feel very lucky to be in a relationship with him. However, I do have a question that I'd like to get to the bottom of. I've been noticing that he's been texting a lot more than usual, and some of the people he's texting are female coworkers. I'm not sure how to approach this situation.
