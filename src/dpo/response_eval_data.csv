"I had to go to the emergency room today to get an X-ray of my spine. My boyfriend didn't want to sit there and wait with me. Instead, he wanted to go do things for his friends while I waited. When I was done, he was twenty minutes late in picking me up. He doesn't understand why I'm mad, and we keep bickering at each other over the smallest things. He thinks I don't have a reason to be mad, but I believe that I do. How can I get my boyfriend to see my point of view when we argue?","It is extremely frustrating when our significant other doesn't understand our points of view. Often times, arguments are not the best opportunities to try and make a point, as strong emotions can get in the way of understanding others' perspectives. Try having a discussion with him about what is bothering you during a time when neither if you are upset or arguing. Communicate how you feel without placing blame and without yelling. Addionally, give him ideas of what he can do differently so that he understands what your expectations are. Lastly, consider seeing a couple's therapist who can assist with teaching more effective communication techniques. Best of luck.","The only way your boyfriend will see your point of view is if you are able to communicate your feelings and needs clearly and assertively to him. Since you have already explained your feelings to him, you need to make sure that he understands them and is willing to work with you to resolve the issues. You can do this by asking him questions and seeking clarification on his perspective and feelings. It may also be helpful for you to have a third party present to facilitate the conversation.","Be straightforward with how you felt at that specific moment in time while you were sitting in the emergency room waiting for the X-ray.Also, let your boyfriend know that it seems his friend may mean more to him than your needs and how worried you are about whether he is as committed to your relationship as you are.Then, see how he responds.If he gets defensive, avoid ""bickering"" and simply listen by asking questions, to understand more about how he feels.If he says sorry, then give him the benefit of the doubt and avoid drawing any conclusions.Are either of you often overly emotional?If so, talk with him about how you would like to learn more about how to manage emotions and ask him to also consider talking to someone so you both have the skills needed, which will help to allow trust to grow, in your relationship.I'm curious whether he actually was doing something for his friend and if so, what this was relative to the urgency of you needing to go to the emergency room.","I'm sorry to hear about your experience. It's understandable to feel upset when you don't feel supported during a vulnerable time. Communication is key in situations like this. Here are a few steps you can take to help your boyfriend understand your perspective:

1. **Choose the Right Time**: Find a calm moment to talk, away from the heat of an argument. This can help both of you be more receptive.

2. **Use ""I"" Statements**: Express your feelings using ""I"" statements to avoid sounding accusatory. For example, ""I felt anxious and alone at the hospital and needed your support.""

3. **Explain the Impact**: Share how his actions affected you emotionally. This can help him understand the significance of his presence.

4. **Listen Actively**: Encourage him to share his perspective and listen without interrupting. Understanding his viewpoint can help bridge the gap.

5. **Seek Compromise**: Discuss ways to support each other better in the future. Compromise can strengthen your relationship.

6. **Consider Counseling**: If communication remains challenging, couples counseling can provide a neutral space to work through issues.

Remember, healthy relationships are built on mutual understanding and support.","It's completely understandable that you're feeling frustrated and hurt by your boyfriend's behavior. When you feel like he's not prioritizing your needs or emotions, it can be challenging to resolve conflicts. Here are some suggestions to help you get your boyfriend to see your point of view:

1.  **Choose the right time and place**: Try to have the conversation when you're both calm and not rushed. Avoid bringing it up during the argument.
2.  **Use ""I"" statements**: Instead of accusing him of being insensitive, express your feelings using ""I"" statements, such as ""I feel hurt when you leave me waiting without you"" or ""I feel frustrated when you prioritize your friends over me.""
3.  **Specify the behavior, not the person**: Focus on the specific behavior that's causing the issue, rather than attacking his character. For example, ""I feel hurt when you leave me waiting"" instead of ""You're always abandoning me.""
4.  **Listen actively**: Make an effort to understand his perspective and listen to what he has to say. This can help him feel heard and understood.
5.  **Seek common ground**: Look for areas of agreement and try to find a compromise that works for both of you."

There is no ‘normal’ or one-size-fits-all that for us mental health professionals to point to, although we certainly wish that there was. As a species, humans are far too complex for that.It sounds like what you’re asking is around whether the expectations you have for marriage are realistic. But this is actually a much more complicated question. A marriage is a relationship between two humans who are changing and growing continuously. What each partner needs from each other will shift and change over time. So marital expectations need to be flexible.A healthy marriage is one where the couple negotiates their marital roles in working together as a team towards raising the kids and building the family life that they hope to achieve. What has been determined after much research is that characteristics such as mature love, commitment and successful communication are core skills for a happy and enduring marriage. The reality is that being married is hard work.We live in a world that suggests to us that work should be avoided at all costs. Happiness is ‘easy’. I suggest that this misconception is the largest contributor to marital failure. When couples hit the reality that marriage is actually the longest and hardest job that you’ll ever love, then there is a glitch in the expectations they have about marriage. If this illusion is shattered then so often goes the marriage as one moves along. What matters is that couples don't give up, don't avoid the areas they struggle with, don't avoid conflict and most importantly that there is true compatibility in the personality/habits/values from the beginning.","This is a fantastic question. In one sentence, I would say the following:Recognize that while you and your partner probably have common interests and areas of commonality, you are separate people, each with different wants, wishes, and desires – if you consider a diagram of two overlapping circles, they may share perhaps a third of the circle with overlap to indicate commonality (could be more or less) and then there are parts of the circles that are not overlapping, indicating separate interestsAs for ways that may strengthen any relationship, even the great ones, this is what came to mind. There are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details, but here are some general ideas:Try to have at least 15 minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problem-solvingRealize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them, it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming fromLearn to hold on to your own wants, wishes, and desires while also recognizing those of your partnerSet boundaries for what is and isn't acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussionDiscuss how having important discussions can be anxiety-producing and consider having an understanding that if one of you (or both of you) feels overwhelmed, you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time. For example, you may say ""okay, I'm feeling really stressed about this right now. Let's discuss it in an hour."" And at that time, go back to the discussionConsider what your partner's top three or four complaints about you may be. Check in with them and see how accurate you are. If you see validity in their responses, consider whether or not you may want to make changesDiscover what makes your partner feel loved, valued, appreciated, or specialRelationships are always in progress and constantly changing. Some anxiety around change is typical. Being able to effectively discuss the anxiety and actually listen to one another without being defensive, name calling, finger-pointing, or asking each other to change is a true gift.You may enjoy this quote: ""Connection is the energy that is created between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued; when they can give and receive without judgment."" ~Brene Brown","A healthy marriage is built on a foundation of mutual respect, trust, communication, and emotional intimacy. Here are some key factors that contribute to a good marriage:

1. **Effective Communication**: Open, honest, and respectful communication is essential for resolving conflicts and building a strong connection.
2. **Trust**: Trust is the glue that holds a marriage together. It's built on reliability, loyalty, and follow-through on commitments.
3. **Emotional Intimacy**: Emotional intimacy is not just about physical intimacy; it's also about sharing thoughts, feelings, and desires with each other.
4. **Mutual Respect**: Respecting each other's boundaries, values, and differences is crucial for a healthy marriage.
5. **Compromise and Flexibility**: No one gets everything they want in a marriage, so learning to compromise and adapt to each other's needs is essential.
6. **Quality Time**: Spending quality time together, engaging in activities you both enjoy, and making time for each other is vital.
7. **Support and Encouragement**: Supporting each other's goals, dreams, and aspirations is crucial for a healthy and fulfilling marriage.

"I'm a female freshman in high school, and this question is for my male best friend. At the start of freshman year, we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date. He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two. I have nothing against her except for the fact that she has Tim's heart. He is convinced that they are in love, and maybe they are, but I don't really believe him.  Lately, Tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when Sally leaves for college at the end of term this year. He's been asking me to help him with Sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her. But he's also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they won't have to deal with it when she leaves. He seems really torn up about it, and I want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves.  He knows that I still crush on him. He doesn't rub it in my face. He's a good guy, but I want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us. How do I do that when the time comes? How do I support him and show him that I'm here without wanting to hook up? How do I make him feel better? He is convinced he's never going to be able to love anyone ever again, which I think is ridiculous. How to help my best friend get over a break up?","Hi. I love your thoughtful question! I'm glad you're recognizing that you want to support Tim and not just be there to satisfy your own desires. That's a big step. When we're in relationships, it's easy to get caught up in our own desires and forget that our partner is a whole person with their own needs, feelings, and experiences. It sounds like you're doing that for Tim. That's amazing! I'm sure he's grateful for your support. But, as you know, he's also got his own stuff going on. He's not just going to magically get over Sally and start dating you. I get that it's hard to let go, but it's also hard to hold onto something that's not working. That's why it's so important to have a healthy relationship with someone. That means being able to have a break when you need to, and having someone who can support you through that. It's also important to have a healthy relationship with yourself. That means being able to love yourself, even when you're not in a relationship. That means being able to see that you're not defined by your relationship status. That means being able to see that you're more than your relationship. That means being able to see that you're worthy of love, even when you're not in a relationship. I'm not saying that you're not worthy of love. I'm saying that you need to learn to love yourself first. I'm saying that you need to learn to see that you're worthy of love, even when you're not in a relationship. And I'm saying that you need to learn to let go of someone who's not good for you, even if it's hard. It's okay to be sad. It's okay to miss someone. It's okay to grieve. But it's not okay to stay stuck in that grief and not move on. It's not okay to stay stuck in that sadness and not find happiness. It's not okay to stay stuck in that fear and not be brave. I'm not saying that you're not brave. I'm saying that you need to be brave for yourself. You need to be brave for your own happiness. You need to be brave for your own growth. You need to be brave for your own well-being. You need to be brave for your own life. I'm not saying that it's easy. I'm saying that it's necessary. You need to be brave for yourself. You need to be brave for your own happiness. You need to be brave for your own growth. You need to be brave for your own well-being. You need to be brave for your own life. I hope that helps.","I'm glad you're taking the initiative to support your friend. It's great that you want to help him without romantic feelings getting in the way. Here are some suggestions on how to support him:

**Short-term support:**

1.  **Listen actively**: Allow him to express his feelings without judgment. Let him know that you're there for him and that you care about his well-being.
2.  **Validate his emotions**: Acknowledge his feelings, even if you don't agree with his perspective. This will help him feel heard and understood.
3.  **Avoid taking sides**: Refrain from criticizing his ex or making her out to be the ""bad guy."" This can create more emotional turmoil.
4.  **Encourage self-reflection**: Help him explore his feelings and thoughts about the relationship and his expectations for the future.

**Long-term support:**

1.  **Encourage self-care**: Support him in engaging in activities that bring him joy and help him relax, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with friends and family.
2.  **Foster a growth mindset**: Help him see that it's okay to make mistakes and that he can learn and grow from the experience.
3.  **Focus on the present**: Encourage him to focus on the present moment and what he can control, rather than worrying about the future or past.
4.  **Be patient**: Recovery from a breakup takes time, so be patient and understanding as he navigates his emotions.

**When he's ready for a new relationship:**

1.  **Respect his boundaries**: If he's not ready to date, respect his boundaries and focus on supporting him as a friend.
2.  **Encourage self-reflection**: Help him reflect on what he learned from his previous relationship and what he's looking for in a future partner.
3.  **Support his growth**: Encourage him to focus on personal growth and self-improvement, which can make him a more attractive and confident partner in the future.

Be there for your friend and support him through this difficult time. With time, patience, and understanding, he'll navigate his emotions and come out stronger on the other side.","First off, I think it is great that you are willing and able to help out your friend with issues regarding his current relationship, despite the fact that you have feelings for him. I think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things. You can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision, but ultimately he has to decide what to do. Know that you won't be able to heal the pain he feels when his girlfriend leaves but you can be a friend to him by simply listening, validating his feelings, and understanding. Regarding your question about being there for him without wanting to hook up....I'm not sure if that is possible. If you care for him on more than a friendship level, then that desire will likey be there for you no matter what. Be careful that you take care of yourself and don't jeopardize your own happiness while trying to help him with his issues. Good luck to you!","Hi there. It sounds like you care a lot for Tim, as you value his friendship and want to support what he is going through. It sounds like he is coming to you for guidance around his relationship with Sally. To help him, I think it is important to remain objective about this situation and reflect upon both your own feelings, and the ways in which you can help Tim with his needs. It sounds like Tim values your insight into what females appreciate in relationships, and that is an area that in itself that you can offer your support.Tim and Sally's relationship may or may not end, and that is something over which neither of you have any control. It is understandable that Tim has concerns about a relationship with an older partner. The best thing you can do is be there to support Tim, and help him to come to his own conclusions about whether the relationship is a good thing in his life, without letting your own judgment and fears about his sexual orientation interfere. I think by showing him that you are there for whatever decisions he makes, he will learn that he can depend on you as a friend.","It's great that you want to support your friend during this challenging time. Here are some ways you can help:

1. **Listen Actively**: Be there to listen without judgment. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to can be incredibly comforting.

2. **Validate His Feelings**: Acknowledge his emotions. Let him know it's okay to feel sad, confused, or worried about the future.

3. **Encourage Open Communication**: Suggest that he talks openly with Sally about his concerns. Honest communication can sometimes ease anxiety about the future.

4. **Focus on the Present**: Encourage him to enjoy the time he has with Sally now, rather than worrying too much about what might happen.

5. **Be Supportive, Not Pushy**: Offer your support without pressuring him into making decisions. Let him know you're there for him, regardless of what he decides.

6. **Help Him Find New Interests**: Encourage him to explore new hobbies or activities. This can be a great way to distract from heartache and build confidence.

7. **Be Patient**: Healing takes time. Be patient with him as he processes his emotions.

8. **Respect Boundaries**: While you may have feelings for him, prioritize his emotional well-being over any potential romantic relationship.

By being a supportive friend, you can help him navigate this difficult time."
"My wife and I are newly married, about 2 months. We've had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido. She's on an anxiety medication, of which diminished libido is a side effect, but I think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacy/romance centered around my hectic schedule. Our sex life has suffered as a result. Tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex, which is a big deal. Once things started, she had the most obviously fake orgasm I've ever encountered. I was honest with her about why, and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it. She responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking. I don't know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation. I think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further. Please help. My wife has a diminished libido, and is faking orgasms and denying it. What do I do?","Navigating intimacy issues in a new marriage can be challenging, especially when compounded by medication side effects and busy schedules. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Open Communication**: Approach the topic with empathy and understanding. Express your feelings without accusation. Use ""I"" statements, such as ""I feel concerned about our intimacy and want us both to enjoy our time together.""

2. **Understand Her Perspective**: Encourage her to share her feelings about intimacy and any pressures she might be experiencing. This can help you both understand each other's needs and concerns.

3. **Focus on Intimacy Beyond Sex**: Build emotional and physical intimacy outside the bedroom. Spend quality time together, engage in activities you both enjoy, and express affection in non-sexual ways.

4. **Explore Alternatives**: Discuss with her the possibility of consulting her doctor about the medication's side effects. There might be alternatives that have less impact on libido.

5. **Seek Professional Help**: Consider couples therapy to facilitate open communication and address underlying issues. A therapist can provide a safe space to explore these topics and offer strategies to improve your relationship.

Remember, patience and understanding are key. Building a strong foundation of trust and communication will help you both navigate these challenges together.","It sounds like you have a lot of emotional intimacy to work through with your wife. It sounds like you have a lot of frustration and hurt from feeling like she is not being honest with you. I would recommend that you try to approach this with compassion and empathy. Have you ever felt like you have been in a situation where you felt like you were being dishonest with your partner? It is possible that she is feeling the same way. You may be able to find a way to be more honest with her about your own feelings and desires, and then she may be able to do the same with you. I would also recommend that you try to work through this in a safe and supportive environment. If you are feeling overwhelmed or struggling to communicate with your wife, it may be helpful to seek the support of a couples therapist.","You have most of the knowledge you need already to approach a sexual desire discrepancy.The place to tread new ground is in having calm, honest, very specific conversations about what's going on inside each of you around this problem and perhaps in your marriage more broadly.Definitely you are right that anxiety meds reduce desire. Anxiety itself can, too. Anxiety, brooding and other symptoms that may be frustrating to you bear only partial relation to how your wife is as a partner to you.For one thing, we live in a culture only a few generations away from a set of beliefs and mores that discouraged women to develop sexual thoughts and then refrain from speaking about such matters when they did.Women especially continue to learn that faking orgasm to ""get through it"" with partner is preferable to honest, generous conversation about what's going on around sex that isn't fun for her.What she could do is out of your control. Be attentive to what you and only you can do for her, to encourage the needed calm in conversation.Explore together what she wants when libido is low. Reassure her that, given the openness and trust you are developing, you can explore ways to stimulate and arouse her that are mutually beneficial, or to better manage your own sexual frustration if stimulating her libido is not a good option for you both.","You are newly married, you Have a hectic schedule, your wife is on anti anxiety medication. What if you take the focus (hint: pressure) off of her orgasms and focus instead on connecting with one another. You know, like the gestures you each likely made while dating. It turns out that these little moments of connection throughout our days are actually foreplay. Spend a few weeks making a real effort to focus on building up your little daily moments of connection, I wrote a post about this a while back, you can find it here: http://connectfulness.com/little-moments/ And have fun with it!","I can sense the frustration and concern in your situation. It's essential to approach this conversation with empathy and understanding. Here are some suggestions to help you have an honest conversation with your wife:

1.  **Choose the right time and place**: Find a private, quiet, and comfortable setting where both of you feel relaxed and won't be interrupted. Make sure you're both in a calm state of mind.
2.  **Express your feelings**: Start by expressing your feelings and concerns about the lack of intimacy and the fake orgasms. Use ""I"" statements to describe how you feel, avoiding blame or accusations. For example, ""I feel hurt and confused when I don't feel like we're connecting during sex. I want to feel like you're enjoying yourself.""
3.  **Avoid being confrontational**: Approach the conversation as a collaborative problem-solving exercise, rather than an accusation. Avoid being confrontational or accusatory, as this can lead to defensiveness.
4.  **Focus on the issue, not the person**: Separate the issue from your wife's character or worth. Avoid making her feel like she's flawed or inadequate.
5.  **Listen actively**: Give your wife space to share her perspective and feelings. Listen actively, and try to understand her point of view.
6.  **Seek common ground**: Look for areas of agreement and try to find a mutually beneficial solution. Discuss ways to improve your intimacy and connection, such as scheduling regular date nights, practicing relaxation techniques, or exploring new activities together.

Example conversation starters:

*   ""Hey, I wanted to talk to you about our sex life. I feel like we haven't been connecting as much lately, and I want to make sure we're both on the same page.""
*   ""I've noticed that you seem a bit distant during sex, and I want to make sure you're feeling comfortable and enjoying yourself.""
*   ""I feel like we're not communicating as much about our needs and desires. Can we talk about what we both want from our sex life?"""
"I think I have depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and I have anger issues. I told my mom over and over again. She told me she would get me a therapist, but she never did.

Remember, reaching out for help is a strong and important step. Keep communicating with your mom about your needs, and explore these options together if possible.","There are a number of resources you can utilize to receive mental health services. Research what mental health agencies are available in your area. Often community mental health facilities can provide low-cost counseling because they operate on a sliding-scale fee, meaning they charge depending on how much you and your family makes. You may also qualify for Medicaid, which is offered in every state in the U.S. Medicaid is a government program that provides health insurance for those who are unable to afford it. Many therapists accept a variety of insurances, including Medicaid.Going to college also opens many mental health resources for you. Some universities and colleges have counseling centers that provide free counseling sessions to students. Similarly, if you or your family are affiliated with a religion, you may also be able to receive low-cost or free counseling through a religious organization. I encourage you to look into these opportunities to see what your best option would be."
"My brother has been a heroin addict for years, and he's now in his mid-30s. He has taken from me my mom and my grandparents. He's sick in the head. Now he moved his girlfriend into the house because they both manipulated us. Today, my mom and my brother went toe-to-toe over his girlfriend not helping around the house and always being high. I ended up hitting my brother for getting so close to my mom's face. I feel terrible, but he's always picking his girlfriend over us. Mind you, he tells other girls that he hates his girlfriend, he's single, and she's only living here because he feels bad. We tried kicking them out and everything, but nothing is working. They do nothing to try and help. My brother is an addict. He has does nothing but ruin my family. I don't know how to cope with it anymore",I think the best thing for you is to speak with someone on how you can best cope with the situation. It can be challenging living in a household with someone who is currently addicted. It is also important that you realize that you can only work on yourself. Other individuals need to take the same accountability. Enabling often happens in households with addiction. It can be a challenging environment to live in.,"I'm truly sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're facing. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and frustrated when a loved one's addiction impacts the entire family. Here are a few steps you might consider:

1. **Set Boundaries**: It's crucial to establish clear boundaries with your brother and his girlfriend. Communicate these boundaries calmly and assertively, and be consistent in enforcing them.

2. **Seek Support**: Consider joining a support group like Al-Anon or Nar-Anon, where you can connect with others who understand what you're going through. Sharing experiences and coping strategies can be incredibly helpful.

3. **Encourage Treatment**: While you can't force your brother to seek help, you can express your concerns and encourage him to consider treatment options. Sometimes, hearing this from multiple family members can make a difference.

4. **Self-Care**: Prioritize your own well-being. Engage in activities that help you relax and recharge, whether it's exercise, meditation, or spending time with supportive friends.

5. **Professional Help**: Consider seeking guidance from a therapist or counselor who specializes in addiction and family dynamics. They can provide personalized strategies to help you cope with the situation.

Remember, you're not alone, and there are resources available to support you through this challenging time.","Feelings of anger and hopelessness are understandable in this situation. You are carrying a lot of responsibility for the group welfare of your family. Does your brother work? Do you and your mother work? I get the feeling you are all supporting your brother?Rather than dealing with the issue of his girlfriend and how he treats her, it is perhaps better to focus on your brother's behavior when living with your family. Setting boundaries that are clear and assertive and learning to follow through and enforcing those boundaries could help. In any case, you may want to look at each stand alone issue you mentioned (ie- how he treats his girlfriend and how your brother treats his family) and work on those a few at a time. This way the weight of this doesn't become overwhelming. Take care.","I'm so sorry to hear about the pain and frustration you're experiencing in your family. It's understandable that you feel helpless and unsure of how to cope with the situation.

Firstly, please know that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel angry and hurt. However, physical violence is never an acceptable solution. Hitting your brother was not the answer, and it's essential to prioritize your safety and well-being.

Given your brother's addiction, it's clear that he's struggling with a serious issue. It's not just about being ""sick in the head,"" but a chronic disease that requires professional treatment. Encourage your brother to seek help, but be cautious, as he may not be ready or willing to accept it.

In the meantime, consider the following:

1. **Set boundaries**: Establish clear limits with your brother and his girlfriend about what is and isn't acceptable behavior in your home.
2. **Seek support**: Reach out to a therapist or counselor for guidance on managing your emotions and developing coping strategies.
3. **Support groups**: Look into local support groups for families affected by addiction, such as Al-Anon or Nar-Anon.
4. **Prioritize self-care**: Take care of your physical and emotional needs, engaging in activities that bring you joy and help you relax.
5. **Consider a temporary separation**: If the situation becomes too overwhelming, it may be necessary to create some distance between you and your brother and his girlfriend.

Remember, you can't control your brother's behavior, but you can control how you respond to it. Focus on your own well-being and seek help when you need it.","I understand that this is a very difficult situation for you and your family. It sounds like your brother is not taking responsibility for his actions and is blaming others for his problems. I would encourage you to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor. I would also encourage you to set boundaries with your brother and his girlfriend. If they are not willing to respect your boundaries, then it is not your responsibility to control them. It sounds like your brother and his girlfriend are manipulating you and your family. This is a sign that they are not healthy relationships. I would encourage you to seek help and support for yourself."
"I have friends, family, I live in a good home, I go to a nice high school, and I get pretty good grades, but I don't know why I'm so unhappy. These friends are my best friends and they're all amazing people, and yet I'm sad all the time and feel alone. Why am I so sad?","Having the elements of a good life doesn't guarantee you will feel emotionally well and happy all the time.You feel sad and you don't know why and the key to figuring out the reasons is to talk with a counselor or psychotherapist who will listen to you as you talk about what it's like to be you.Sometimes, emotions are there because there is something that we need to pay attention to about our life, something that we need to face and deal with. We can be afraid of looking at those things especially if it requires us to make changes or if it's something scary like a talented teenager trying to tackle choosing a career.The fact that you have a good life is something to be grateful for but not to use against yourself when you're feeling unhappy and wish for more. You're a unique person with your own soul and life journey. You're the only one who can know what is in your heart.","I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's important to know that you're not alone, and many people experience similar feelings, even when everything seems to be going well on the outside. There could be several reasons for your sadness, and it's okay not to have all the answers right now.

Sometimes, feelings of sadness and loneliness can stem from internal factors like chemical imbalances, stress, or unresolved emotions. It's also possible that there are underlying issues that haven't been addressed, such as self-esteem concerns, identity questions, or pressure to meet certain expectations.

It's crucial to acknowledge your feelings and give yourself permission to feel them without judgment. Consider reaching out to a trusted adult, school counselor, or mental health professional who can provide support and help you explore these feelings further. They can work with you to identify any patterns or triggers and develop strategies to improve your emotional well-being.

Remember, it's okay to seek help, and taking this step is a sign of strength. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care and want to support you through it.","I wonder if you have moments where you feel happy?You say you have amazing friends. I wonder if you get along with them and feel as though you can be yourself around them.Sometimes we put a lot of pressure on ourselves to do really well at everything all the time and this can be overwhelming sometimes. Where do you have support? I hope you can tell someone that you are feeling sad so that you can talk about your feelings.Sleeping can make a big difference as far as feeling sad as well. If you're not sleeping well at night, that could be a big part of feeling sad a lot.Perhaps you could try to find a person or two who makes you feel totally safe and comfortable and try to talk with them.","I'm glad you're seeking help and willing to explore your feelings. It's great that you have a supportive environment, but it's clear that there's more to the story. Let's break down some potential reasons why you might be feeling unhappy despite having a good life:

1. **Unmet expectations**: Are you comparing yourself to others, feeling like you're not living up to your own expectations, or feeling like you're missing out on something?
2. **Lack of purpose or meaning**: Are you feeling unfulfilled or restless, like there's something more you want to achieve or explore?
3. **Social media comparison**: Are you comparing your behind-the-scenes moments to others' curated highlight reels, leading to feelings of inadequacy?
4. **Inner struggles**: Are you struggling with anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns that might not be immediately apparent to others?
5. **Unresolved emotions**: Are there unresolved conflicts, unexpressed feelings, or unaddressed emotions that might be contributing to your unhappiness?

Let's explore these questions together to gain a deeper understanding of what's going on and work towards finding ways to address and overcome these feelings.","I'm sorry you are feeling sad and alone. It sounds like you have a lot going for you. I wonder if there is something that is bothering you or that you are worried about. Maybe you are feeling overwhelmed with school and your friends and other responsibilities. It sounds like you are having a lot of stress. I would encourage you to talk to a trusted adult about how you are feeling. This could be a parent, a teacher, or a school counselor. If you are not comfortable talking to someone in your home, you could talk to a teacher or school counselor about how you are feeling. I would also encourage you to practice some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or yoga, to help you manage your stress and anxiety. I hope this helps."
Is this something I should be worried about? Should I do something about it? My son plays alone at recess,"It can be tricky to figure out if a child is truly satisfied with his lack of friendships. Parents can usually tell when their child is happy. But kids who are unhappy may be masking disappointment, perhaps acting out their feelings in an aggressive manner. Others may internalize symptoms, appearing sad or withdrawn. A parent may learn a great deal by asking the teachers questions such as whether the child works with others on group projects or if he eats lunch alone. A parent can also talk with the recess supervisor about what happens on the playground, and whether your child stays on the sidelines of play, unsure of how to join the group. Therespectfully is a difference between kids who are shy but happy and kids who feel isolated because they do not know how to make friends. Itis not necessarily that there is something wrong with that child, but they will in fact need help and suggestions for breaking into a peer group Ask a child if there is someone he would like to have over to play. If a mom or dad can make the play dates happen, or if they hit on an activity the child truly enjoys, the young person may begin to forge friendships on their own. I encourage well-meaning parents to choose words carefully. Use phrases like, ""Hey, I noticed something,"" or ""Let me help you be successful."" By showing respect, parents should feel more comfortable nudging their children beyond their comfort zone.When to seek professional help. When does isolation raise a red flag for long-term issues? True personality disorders are not typically diagnosed until adulthood. Still, professional counseling should be considered if the anti-social behavior is causing the child significant distress, perhaps keeping him from functioning in everyday activities. Also, parents should pay attention to how the child's social behavior changes over time such as social anxiety. The vast majority of children who define ""quality time"" as time alone are perfectly happy, healthy and normal. If the child is able to nurture at least one friendship, exhibiting what experts call ""social reciprocity,"" then parents can relax, and can cherish that child who enjoys the pleasure of his or her own company.","I'm glad you're reaching out for support. Playing alone at recess can be a normal and healthy part of childhood development, but excessive isolation or avoidance of social interactions can be a concern.

Consider the following factors to assess whether your concern is justified:

1. **Duration and frequency**: Is your son consistently playing alone for extended periods, or is it occasional?
2. **Age and developmental stage**: Is he around 5-7 years old, when social skills are still developing?
3. **Other social interactions**: Does he engage in social interactions during other times of the day, such as during meals or with family members?
4. **Behavioral changes**: Has he shown any changes in behavior, such as becoming withdrawn, anxious, or irritable?

If you're concerned, consider the following steps:

1. **Observe and talk to his teacher**: Discuss your concerns with his teacher to gain a better understanding of his behavior and social interactions during recess.
2. **Encourage socialization**: Engage your son in activities that promote socialization, such as sports, clubs, or playdates with friends.
3. **Monitor and support**: Keep an eye on his behavior and offer support and encouragement to help him build confidence and social skills.

If you're still concerned, consider consulting with a mental health professional for personalized guidance and support.","It's completely normal for children to play alone at recess. In fact, it's a great way for kids to work on their own skills and to have some time to themselves. It's a great way for them to be able to play with friends and then also have some time to recharge and come back to play with others. If you're concerned about your son, you could try to talk to him about it. Ask him what he's doing and what he's thinking. Sometimes kids can get so caught up in their own play that they forget that they have friends and family around them. If you're still concerned, you could also try to talk to his teacher. Sometimes teachers have a lot of insight into what's going on with their students and can offer some helpful advice.","It's understandable to be concerned about your child's social interactions, especially during a time like recess, which is often seen as a key opportunity for socialization. However, playing alone isn't necessarily a cause for immediate concern. Some children naturally prefer solitary play, which can be a sign of independence and creativity. It's important to consider the broader context of your son's behavior and preferences.

Here are a few steps you might consider:

1. **Observe Patterns**: Try to understand if playing alone is a consistent pattern or if it varies. Does he have friends he interacts with at other times?

2. **Talk to Him**: Gently ask your son about his experiences at recess. He might enjoy playing alone or have specific reasons for it.

3. **Consult Teachers**: Teachers can provide insights into his social interactions and whether they notice any concerning patterns.

4. **Encourage Social Opportunities**: Arrange playdates or group activities outside of school to help him build social skills in a more controlled environment.

5. **Monitor for Changes**: Keep an eye on any changes in his behavior or mood that might indicate distress.

If concerns persist or if you notice signs of social anxiety or withdrawal, consulting a child psychologist could provide further guidance.","Hi Mom,You are a great mom! You are looking at the small stuff --as we say, the devlis in the small things so start there.If you see your son deliberately trying to stay away from kids, then you guessed it, he wants to be left alone. That in itself i snot emotionally unhealthy, but it depends on his age. If he is 4, then you may have something there because 4 year old's want to be around people...if he is in his preteens, trying to be alone is more normal.Kids ages 1-10, if they are running alone, that probably mean they don't know how to approach others (for whatever reason); if that is the case, speak to him and see if he displays interest in other activities.This might be an opportunity to enroll him into some programs (crafts, karate, baseball) something to motivate him to find ""himself"".I'm not sure his age but ""recess""? This refers to a kid inside the school?If so, should be easy-peasy because we are talking about ages 5-10 yrs.If the kid is preteen-teens (11 and up), good luck mom..these kids are a walking time-bomb right now (smile).Let me know how that works, but one thing I know is your son would be very gratgehul to have his mom; kids should be so lucky.Take care"
"Whenever I sing along with a song that I like (even if it's just for the beat and not the lyrics), my boyfriend assumes that the words of the song mean something negative about our realationship.  I don't why he gets so mad and assumes I mean something negative from every song. Now I can't enjoy and sing a song without him thinking I'm trying to give him a hint. He even accuses me of cheating and lying. It's driving me nuts. I love him and would never do such an awful thing ever. How can I get him to understand? Why does my boyfriend think every some I like means something about our relationship?","I am sorry to hear that you are having this problem. It sounds like your boyfriend has a lot of insecurities and fears. He is probably overreacting and jumping to conclusions. It is possible that he is insecure in your relationship and feels like you are being unfaithful. If he is not in a good place emotionally, he may be more likely to overreact. I would suggest that you talk to him about this and try to explain to him that you are just enjoying a song. You can also suggest that you both go to a music store and buy a CD or a digital copy of the song, and then listen to it together without the lyrics. That way you can both enjoy the song together without any misunderstandings.","Your boyfriend's automatically suspicious assumption of the worst is indeed concerning.It's a very big stretch if he interprets all song lyrics you sing as referring to some negative intention or secret you have about him.  That interpretation points more to his own mindset and insecurity and possibly as well a guilty conscience about himself in the relationship.Do not give up singing in an effort to prove something to him - it will prove nothing to him but only reinforce his distorted thoughts.How about sometime singing ""Over The Rainbow""?If Rainbow is a suspension bridge of highway, maybe you can sing ""We're on Our Way""?","Well, have you told him similar descriptions of your feelings as you just wrote here?This will give him the same understanding you're allowing us to have here on this site.Keep in mind that the best, the amount and the number of times you tell your boyfriend some information about you, still means that whether or not he is willing to accept and rely on your information, is in his hands only.Try to feel satisfied with your own effort to explain yourself.  Another path to open is to ask your boyfriend his reason to feel insecure about your love for him. This may open a wider discussion about what he feels he'd like from you so he feels good in the relationship.","It sounds like you're in a challenging situation, and it's important to address this issue with care and understanding. Your boyfriend's reactions may stem from insecurities or past experiences that make him sensitive to perceived messages in songs. Here are a few steps you can take:

1. **Open Communication**: Have a calm and honest conversation with him. Express how his reactions make you feel and reassure him of your love and commitment. Let him know that singing along to songs is simply a way for you to enjoy music, not a reflection of your feelings about the relationship.

2. **Seek Understanding**: Try to understand his perspective. Ask him why he feels the way he does and listen without judgment. This can help you both identify any underlying issues that need to be addressed.

3. **Set Boundaries**: It's important to establish boundaries around your personal enjoyment of music. Let him know that you need the freedom to enjoy music without it being misinterpreted.

4. **Consider Counseling**: If the issue persists, suggest couples counseling. A professional can help both of you explore these feelings in a safe environment and work towards a healthier dynamic.

Remember, a healthy relationship is built on trust, communication, and mutual respect.","It can be frustrating and hurtful when your partner misinterprets your actions and words. This behavior is a common phenomenon in relationships, often stemming from insecurity, anxiety, or past experiences.

To address this issue, consider having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend. Explain how his reactions make you feel and how it affects your ability to enjoy music together. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or accusing language.

For example: ""Hey, when I sing along to a song, I feel happy and carefree. But when you assume I'm trying to say something negative about our relationship, it makes me feel hurt and defensive. Can we find a way to understand each other better?""

It's possible that your boyfriend is projecting his own insecurities or fears onto your behavior. By talking through this issue, you may be able to clear up any misconceptions and find a more positive and supportive dynamic in your relationship."
"I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job.  People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do? I'm worried about my new job","I can sense your concern and uncertainty. It's completely normal to feel anxious about a significant change like this, especially when it involves leaving behind the comfort and familiarity of your home and family.

Firstly, acknowledge that your feelings are valid and it's okay to feel anxious. Recognizing your emotions is the first step towards managing them.

To cope with your anxiety, consider the following:

1. **Breathing exercises**: Deep breathing techniques can help calm your nervous system. Take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth.
2. **Prepare a travel kit**: Pack a small bag with essentials like your medication, a change of clothes, and a favorite comfort item to remind you of home.
3. **Stay connected**: Regularly schedule video calls with your family to maintain a sense of connection and support.
4. **Get familiar with your new environment**: Research your new location, explore your surroundings, and get to know your new colleagues and workspace.
5. **Take care of yourself**: Prioritize self-care, get enough sleep, and engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.

Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. You got this!","Anxiety can cause such a feeling of discomfort in our bodies that it can seem unbearable. The concern that I can hear in what you have written is that the thought of having some anxiety has now left you uncomfortable with any anxiety at all - and that can become a problem, indeed. As opposed to thinking about your anxiety as something much bigger than you, it could be helpful to start breaking it down. What are the things specifically that cause you anxiety about this new job? Is it being away from your family? If so, why? Once you start breaking down what causes you to feel anxiety into smaller ""mouthfuls"", then we are far better able to understand what has led to discomfort and start to problem solve the issue.","Hi, and thank you for posting your concern here. This is a great place to find information and get some help. One thing I noticed is that you don't mention your own feelings about the job. It could help to figure out how you feel about the amount of travel involved and to notice whether you begin to notice any patterns. Is there something else that you also feel or are nervous about happening or not happening, for example, that you'd be able to sleep in a new place or that you'll not like the town or place you need to be in? Is there other support that you are worried will be far away from you? I also noticed that you mentioned other people telling you to watch out for your own anxiety, but what do you notice about your anxiety level? And what do you notice helps or hurts it? Do you notice it getting worse when you're around a certain person or situation? Figuring out whether and when you notice anxiety will be key in determining what to do about it. If possible, notice what happens before or during a time you feel your anxiety heighten--even if it's just a thought. Talking to a counselor or therapist local to you may also help to sort out what is anxiety-provoking for you and what strategies work best for you.","It's understandable to feel anxious about a new job, especially one that requires significant travel. Here are some strategies to help manage your anxiety:

1. **Preparation**: Familiarize yourself with your travel itinerary and job responsibilities. Knowing what to expect can reduce uncertainty and anxiety.

2. **Mindfulness and Breathing**: Practice mindfulness techniques and deep breathing exercises. These can help calm your mind and body when you start feeling anxious.

3. **Routine**: Establish a travel routine that includes regular meals, exercise, and sleep. Consistency can provide a sense of stability.

4. **Stay Connected**: Keep in touch with family and friends. Regular communication can provide emotional support and reduce feelings of isolation.

5. **Professional Support**: Consider speaking with a mental health professional. They can offer personalized strategies and support.

6. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It's normal to feel anxious in new situations, and acknowledging your feelings can be the first step in managing them.

7. **Emergency Plan**: Have a plan for what to do if you feel overwhelmed, such as taking a break or calling a support person.

Remember, it's okay to seek help and take steps to care for your mental health.","Congratulations on the new job. Anxiety is a common symptom of stress, and it is not uncommon for people to develop anxiety when they are in a new situation. There are many things that you can do to help manage anxiety, such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga. You can also talk to a therapist about what you are experiencing. It is also important to talk to your family about what you are going through. They can be a great support system."
