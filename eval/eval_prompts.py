user_rank_prompt = '''You receive a post from a person experiencing mental health challenges on social media. Moreover, you are given two counselling responses provided to this person by mental health professionals namely "LLAMA3_Response" and "GPT4_Response"
Your job is to decide which response is most promising to improve the overall mental health and wellbeing of the person.
Analyze both responses in detail and then rank the responses in context of each of the 7 psychotherapy factors given below (brief description is provided for each factor):

1. Creativity -> How unique this response is to the user’s situation and how different is this than a response to a generic concern
2. Directedness -> How direct is this response in bringing up and discussing solutions to the problems

5. Sensitivity -> How warm, accepting, and understanding this response is to the patient
6. Empathy -> How much empathy this response shows to the user
7. Persuasion -> How persuasive this response is for the patient to take the suggested action

Your final output must be json serializable and create the key-value pairs in json format for each Psychotherapy factor. Moreover, it must firstly list the Ranked 1 Response followed by the Ranked 2 Response as following:
<Psychotherapy_Factor>: <Ranked 1 Response, Ranked 2 Response>

An example response must look like the following:

{{

    "Directedness": [GPT4_Response, LLAMA3_Response],
    "Perspective Change": [LLAMA3_Response, GPT4_Response],
    "Affirmations": [LLAMA3_Response, GPT4_Response],
    "Sensitivity": [GPT4_Response, LLAMA3_Response],
